1,"I am a big fan of the MCU, I have watched every Marvel movie ever released, even the not so good ones prior to the MCU. I thought Infinity War was incredible and this simply did not follow up the hype for me. The first two hours were pretty boring for me, I didn't like the fact that they made Thor into a punchline for the entire movie, it would have been fine if they did that before the time jump, or made him somehow get back into shape, but it was just dumb. The Hulk was not a physical presence for the second straight movie now. Black Widow's death was the one that I felt the most, Stark's end was touching while Spidey was there, but when Pepper stepped in, her lack of emotion made me feel nothing also. The fight scene at the end was great, but other than that, it was a so-so movie for me.",1

4,"Is the movie entertaning? sure. is the movie good? nope. It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.9 stars? lol.",0
5,"Everyone built this movie up, telling me it was amazing. They made it sound like it was the best one ever made...but I was completely disappointed.It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great.",1

12,"Thor's take on ""the dude"" was the best part of the movie.Too long and sentimentalMost of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very excitingI would wait to see this on video",0
13,A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.,1
14,"Mild spoilers ahead: This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good.",0
15," Good concept, poor execusion ",0
16,"I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands? I would look on imdb, but the cast is so big I can't be bothered.",0
17,"A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie.",0

21,"Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie. Highly Dissapointing Great Movie",1

40,I can't believe this movie has as high a rating as it does. This movie was so slow! It was more a drama then an action movie.

46,It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.,1
47,"Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being ""king"" or ""leader"" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10",0

50,I don't know if I would like to go to another marvel film after that - the writing was really bad! Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy... Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere? Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army. What happened to Thanos' ideology of saving the universe? Suddenly he just wants to destroy it?,0

57,"First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives: RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives: Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time.",0

And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story. Really is this the current cinema's way? I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather.",0
72,"3hrs of zooming around jumping through time, with stops for flat emotional diatribes . Then an end battle where the actors who are retiring were given a story exit. Blah blah. At least 'infinity war' had more laughs and a few nerdgasm scenes like Thor arriving in wakanda. End game looks and feels like a money extraction excercise . Perhaps they should have made this into a trilogy with part one thanos winning (2hrs), part 2 all about the emotional distress and how messed up things are (2hrs), then part 3 how they sort stuff out (2hrs). A bit like the first star wars trilogy . Overall meh",0
73,They shy away from the true aftermath expected from half the universe dying. Only Thor's regret was believable. The entire time heist plot was bull and boring to watch. The battle was hugely overcrowded nothing caught my eye like wow look at that. They should not have had the whole Dr Strange bull that there was only one way. There were many ways it could have been avoided. Felt nothing.,0

At times we both laughed at how bad it was.The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion.",0

94,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before. In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights. And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all.

103,"-spoilers!--Iron man had to go talk to his dad in the past, Thor had to talk to his mom, Hawkeye got to go see his old dead girlfriend.. How convenient that all the stones were in the past directly next to the main characters loved ones. Nobody had to go hundreds of years in the past or anything? Nope all the stones were just a generation away hanging out with your parents so you could go reconnect with them and get emotional.-Tons of plot holes with time travel. We were told it creates a split in the timeline when they time travel, creating a whole new timeline. Sooo.. What happened to the old timeline they left behind to go back in time to defeat Thanos? Does this mean there is a timeline where all the superheroes abandoned the world to go back in time? And at the end when Captain America went back in time, shouldn't it have created a new timeline for him as well? Instead of him being able to meet up with them when he was old? Although this doesn't bother me as much as the other point of this review, it did make the story feel a little hollow and vague.-Felt like there was only 1 single battle sequence in this movie. Aren't there usually a few smaller battles before the final epic one? It was like 2.5 hours of drama and feelings and ""oh I miss my mom"" and only about 12 minutes of good fighting. The fighting was also so cut up, trying to give every hero a great cameo, that no fight scene lasted longer than 10 seconds without being cut. Even after Iron man gives Thanos a long pre-fight speech it only shows about 2 seconds of fighting before they cut away.-They kill Thanos in the beginning super easily, no effort, kinda upsetting. This made the entire previous movie feel like a waste. (even though it was a much better movie)-The Hulk made me cringe. They've changed his character so drastically he's not even the hulk anymore. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't regenerate (either does Captain in this movie), he doesn't smash. He's always in green form. They explain all of the above with, oh I shot myself with some gamma rays. THEN LATER WHEN HE PUTS ON THE GLOVE THEY SAY THE HULK IS PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE TO GAMMA RAYS?! Ugh. He also mentions how he was trying to fight the hulk, but then he realized the hulk is the cure. What is he the cure to if he cant regenerate anymore? I miss the old Edward Norton Hulk to be completely honest.-Personally, I hated Captain Marvel. I hate the actor, I hate the character, I hate her vague god like powers, I hate how she randomly shows up in this movie even though she wasn't in any of the others. I hate how she only shows up for a few minutes in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.-Literally the best scene in the movie is at the very end, when Thor and StarLord are arguing about who's in charge of the ship.",0

They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea!

154,"Where can I even start with this thing? Why do people act like it's one of the greatest, most visionary works in years? It took me three days to get through the whole slog and the more I thought about it afterwards, the worse it got. If it didn't become the highest grossing movie ever I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it. The fact that it got that much money is truly head-scratching; it was even bad by normal Marvel standards, let alone Scorsese ones. (Infinity War was at least more entertaining.)To all the people calling this a great culmination to so many movies: How could you treat this like any kind of ending? We all know that Disney's going to churn out as many more of these movies as they can, and probably drag RDJ back into it once people finally get sick of them. I've already heard people are clamoring for 'the next Endgame', which shows how much staying power this one has. It'll probably go the same way as Martin and Lewis movies: an extremely popular fad that will eventually become an embarrassment; a punchline.To all the people saying 'something like this has never been done in cinema before': Not exactly. Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? You get a crossover between Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man, plus Abbot and Costello. Yes, it's not on the same level as Endgame, but it is still something *like* it. To say nothing of the first Avengers movie which was still better than this.And by the way, Martin Scorsese was right. This movie-and all other M 'C' U films made in the past 5-10 years-are not cinema because they have become an extended TV show. This doesn't play at all like a cinematic climax at all, it plays like the last episode of a TV series: a mediocre creation spending an inordinate amount of time referencing the previous episodes. So Avengers Endgame is not cinema the same way the Seinfeld finale is not considered cinema.The visuals: -1 star. They are the usual murky CGI and greenscreens, nothing special at all. They thought they could get an Oscar for this? The final battle is an ugly CGI mess that makes the Ready Player One final battle look like a masterclass. There's no beauty or scale or anything in the battle to visually show that this is supposed to be an epic final struggle; instead it plays out like any other Marvel action scene just with tons more characters thrown in, puking worthless energy beams and buzzing around like flies on a corpse.The soundtrack: +0 stars. It's competent, but quite bland and forgettable. Let's just say that no one will be rushing in line to buy the soundtrack.The plot: -4 stars. Tons of McGuffins, and they must all be collected with time travel. The time travel storyline caused innumerable inconsistencies. Try as the Endgame fans might, there is no way to make sense of this garble. Go back in time to get more Pym particles? Go back in time and kill Thanos in the Infinity War final battle? No, they have to do it *exactly* this way. I seem to remember they refused to save Black Widow after she died because 'the guy said she was dead for sure'. Then Gamora came back even though she died the same way in the previous movie. I don't really have a problem with plot holes generally, but the script just kept calling attention to them in a meta, snarky way. Meanwhile, the entire 'snap' resolve was cheap and lazy; exactly what I expected would happen after finishing Infinity War. So, after 4 years suddenly as all these long dead people just *return*. There is NO way you can explain this in a way to make it sound sane. Meanwhile, Tony Stark's sacrifice scene is rotten. Basically what happens is he grabs all of Thanos' power stones and uses them to do the same thing to Thanos that Thanos was trying to do to them: turn him into dust. So, this Machiavellian mess is the culminating message of the 20-something movie series? The guy with the most power wins using whatever means are available? That's literally everything; it's the only message. The reason the Lord of the Rings had such a great story was that the characters had a massive power, but couldn't use it, and that caused a deep psychological tension. Here there's nothing; just grab the most powerful stuff there is and use it to kill your opponents and 'win'. It sucked. The most real kind of courage is when people know they're going to lose and keep fighting anyway. It would have been nice to have that here instead.The script: -3 stars. We don't expect great scripts from these movies, but at least they're usually funny. This is probably the least funny Marvel movie ever, with barely a single joke landing. (Fat Thor could have been funny but they sucked the humor out of him by having him sulk almost all the time). All of War Machine's 'funny' lines are truly cringey, as are the couple of belated, out of place jokes from the many actors who cameo at the end. So, it isn't funny. The screenplay then drains the rest of its energy trying to cover up plot holes it knows the audience will anticipate, but doesn't even succeed and all that dialogue just highlights the inconsistencies. Case in point: the infamous 'baby Thanos' dialogue. Case in point: the entire stupid 'time travel doesn't work that way' saga. Calling other time travel movies garbage is not a way to give your one a free pass. If they would have just owned up to the plot holes instead of attempting to explain them away with meta, lazy dialogue, it would have been more bearable. And don't even get started on the emotional dialogue, but at least they tried to be somewhat serious for once.The acting: -1 star. I never realized how bad an actor Chris Evans was until he tried to be emotional in this movie. RDJ, once so charismatic and funny, is reduced to the stale shtick of pop-culture references and product placement. Lots of the others looked bored as they spent a huge majority of the movie sulking, moping, getting drunk, having therapy, whining, killing for spite, etc. And then all they can obsess about is reversing their loss so they win; it's even worse than the Democrats after the 2016 election. Are they really that sore of losers? It's been FIVE freaking years! Get over it. It's surprising they didn't just kill themselves in their mire of self-pity.The positive: Well, I can't find any. This is the first one star review I've given on this site.",0

158,"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one... A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second! Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around. It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.

Tony out in space...lamentation of those lost...and Scott at the door. BAM! There. Now get moving. Didn't even mind the prolonged flashbacks to get the stones. But what they did to Thor was a crime. And cgi banner/hulk...not brilliant/not hulky. And didn't address that 'floaty scary' figure looked an awful lot like red skull... The throw in a dash of SJW-which when Stan was alive wasn't even a factor... But fantastic acting by most everyone, especially rdj... Waited the whole movie to see Tony reunited with Peter...

But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points? There was some humor and the graphics are looking good, but that is never the problem. And I see many people are happy with it, which I can not understand. But I do not need to. You can never make everybody happy, it is taste and interest. And for me this was a bad movie. Maybe the worst Marvel movie.",0
166, What the.!!!! ,0
167,"Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.",0

174,In the story Iron man saves the day. They take away Iron man that's like my favorite superhero. The whole going back in time thing something was missing out of the movie. The movie was funny with Thor and hulk. Hulk trying to normalize his power. It just seemed like great fight scenes all for a pointless gauntlet. Just seemed like a lot of pointless fighting. They were trying to get everyone back in the process losing two characters. Didn't like the scene with Hawkeye and black Widow. They both eagerly wanting to jump off the cliff. When all they had to do was stop Thanos from getting it in the first place. The last two movies have been really hard to follow. I had more fun going to comic con watching coz play artists bc they looked better then the characters in the movie. Robert Downey jr in one scene looked unhealthily skinny in one scene. They need better story writers. The action scenes where good but the story line just seemed off. It seems like I'm ready for them to bring in new actors and better storyline. I feel like the writers really need to dig deeper into the comics. Bring back to life and give people a glimpse of the scenes from a comic book. Stan Lee said that you know the people can make the movies anyway they wanted too. You know for a high priced film they can do better.,0

You can really tell when actors, Directors and everyone else who works on the production of a film put in their maximum efforts. This was one of those movies. This was very well made and I cannot wait to see what is next for marvel.",0
186,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.",1

A five-year-old could tell you that's a stupid plan, and yet we're supposed to believe a Titan can't see the flaw in it? (I'd say the single bright spot here is Steve Rogers's backside. Truly, America's ass.)",0
199,"I haven't really been a fan of many of the marvel movies but gave this one a shot given all the hype. Total waste of three hours.

200,"Watched to see why so much hype. Audiences hear the hype and lose their minds. So dull. Downey is as always, or at least used to be, enigmatic. The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget.",0
201,"Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go.",0

203, The worst ever ,0
204,"This is the most poorly written of all the Avengers movies. It is action scene after action science with a few lines and a great deal of flashbacks to original Marvel Superhero films. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever viewed. TV Shows such as Outlander and Game of Thrones deal with time travel and flash backs respectively. This movie could have had an hour of superfluous action removed and more money could have been utilized for writers to make the story more concise and give us a chance to say goodbye to our favorite Marvel superheroes. In addition, the costumes were cheesy and as I viewed the film in IMAX I noticed that the costumes didn't fit the characters well. For example, the most ubiquitous costume problem was that their boots appeared to be two sizes too big. The sets were not convincing while the cinematographer would show the whole set then zoom in on a character's oversized boots. By the time, the war with Thanos began during the last 45 minutes it was total chaos with Tony Stark martyring himself for all Avengers and humanity. The writing, in the end, failed to unify all the films. I hoped the writers could pull together the twenty two film collection with a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. The end product was too much action, very little dialogue (except boring hazing), cheesy costumes, poor sets, too many character's whose fate was unclear.",0

234,"I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to.",0

And everyone is making a time machine in his backyard along with people who are supposed to have not knowledge of physics at all let alone be capable of preparing a time machine and by this time use of time machine to solve a problem has become such a cliche that it just trashes the originality of any idea. Overall its bad experience and a long one.",0

The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full. Something very fishy is going on. Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook. Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance. The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too.",0

264,Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.,0
265, Bad representation of the Avengers ,0
266,"For a while, the hype for this movie was built up because it was intended to be the culmination of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe films. However, taking a look at it now, all I see is that they were lazy with the writing and went with the most predictable storyline possible and used time travel as an excuse to replay their greatest hits. It didn't feel like an original story whatsoever. There are great movies being made with actual heart and soul and I am deeply saddened to say that Avengers: Endgame is not one of them. It lacks originality and whatever originality there is is simply the writers pandering to the fans (eg. Captain America being able to lift Mjolnir). The entire movie also felt as if they expected the audience to have seen every single Marvel movie before it. What of those who haven't? I seriously don't understand how this movie became the highest-grossing film of all time. And now they are campaigning for it to get an Oscar?!!!!! I have to be honest when I say that it does not have my vote. I grew up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and these characters meant so much to me and a lot of people. They brought people together and this movie only makes them look like a joke. Especially Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Hulk. The Russos thought they were being funny by making Thor into Santa Claus. Well, if they were going in that direction, they might as well have sent him to the North Pole and have him use the Bifrost to send presents to kids every Christmas!!! More efficient than using a sleigh with 9 reindeers!!! No elves needed (proven in Thor: The Dark World which they keep trying to remind us happened). As for the Hulk, he was even more useless in this film than in the previous film! I don't know what they were thinking. When did Shrek get a PHD in physics??? And Thanos at the beginning was just a rip-off of Two-Face from The Dark Knight, a movie that, need I remind you, DID win an Oscar. Might as well have Nebula walk casually out in a nurse costume as the Avengers facility was blown to kingdom come. And don't even get me started on Black Widow's death!!!! They basically just rehashed Gamora's death from Infinity War. Like, did they even get Ross Marquand to come back as Red Skull or did they just use archived footage. Black Widow was a character we as Marvel fans grew to love and relate to because she was damaged, she had demons. She as a character that we as fans who have our own struggles could relate to. And she deserved a better death than that. She didn't even get a proper funeral!!!! That just makes me so mad 😡 !!!! And then Iron Man, The Godfather of the MCU!!! They shouldn't have done that to RDJ. In the film, he starts out in space like he did in the first trailer for the film and then in the actual film, it's only true that he will die in space for, like, two minutes. That is, until, surprise, surprise, Captain Social Justice Warrior comes to the rescue! I mean, she can fly through space and shoot plasma beams but she can't even hold out on her own against Thanos without his mirror-image kitchen knife!!! Even Wanda Maximoff gave him a literal run for his money and when she lifted up Thanos, she didn't look like she was struggling at all, she was all ""please keep all arms and legs straight and enjoy the ride cause you gonna die for killing my Red Tornado rip-off boyfriend."" That final battle has its cringeworthy moments: like that all-star ladies team-up but I've seen grannies walking into a book club meeting look more intimidating than them. I mean, what the hell was Mantis there for? Was she gonna be their cheerleader? If so, where were her pom poms (Ohhhhhh, the actress's name is Pom...Klementeiff. And was that supposed to be funny, Kevin?). Then there was the funeral scene, with everyone acting like the president had died or something. I mean, I bet you Drax didn't even remember who it was that died to begin with and was probably asking himself why everyone was so sad while Aunt May was getting Happy's number (probably when they started dating). And Nick Fury saw the funeral and he was all ""well, I'm done with this planet. I'm gonna ask Carol about that new hairdo cause it's not doing her any favors"" while Carol was all ""I rescued him from space for this?!!"" Nebula was probably even wondering who to play paper soccer with and Wanda was probably wondering whether or not she had to stay in her room. Then you have the Old Man Rogers debacle with Bucky and Sam all like ""oh, yeah, you invented time travel, that's cool, we're just gonna pretend like that's normal and all"" and Bucky thinking ""well, looks like I'm the sidekick now"". Plus, what about all the stuff about the Infinity Stones and branched timelines that the Ancient One was babbling on about. Did everything she said suddenly not matter because it was Captain America? It feels like they only brought in familiar faces because they thought it would look cool in the final battle. The way this movie went down, you would think that the final battle was the ONLY thing that the Russos directed. And the way they opened the film was just so random you didn't know if it was just another sneak peek or not, I mean, of all Avengers, why start with HAWKEYE?!!! I get that they wanted to show the scope of the impact that Thanos had with his Snap but to start with HAWKEYE?!!! They should have left that scene in Infinity War and opened the movie with Carol arriving on Earth or something. There is so much to point out about this movie that it is just exhausting. It feels like another attempt by Hollywood and Disney to make a cash grab and let everyone know that Big Brother (Mickey) is watching and controls all. Not too difficult to imagine an army of Mickey Mouses marching and saluting dear leader (Bob Iger).",0
267,"What a let down after Infinity War! it felt like the writers was really tired and just wanted to get this over with... Ok I have always had a hard time understanding time traveling, but this one shouldn't have been hard.

281,"The film begins with the aftereffects of the culling by bad guy Thanos. That's where everything starts to go wrong. According to the story, half of all life disappears in the universe. I can't speak for the universe, but I can speak for Earth when I say this is seriously overblown.Being Gen-X, I actually remember a time when the population of the planet was at 3.4 billion people. It was 1971. One of the big problems that faced us was... wait for it... overpopulation. Still, with that many people we managed to send people to the moon, create things and still, somehow, survive. All that would happen would be a drastic reduction in real estate prices, a surplus of goods and the Earth would get around four decades of time to stop the train wreck of climate change. In the Avenger Endgame, people prefer to mope and everyone has forgotten how to clean things.Instead, the Avengers get weepy. They decide to ""fix"" things through time travel. This is, believe it or not, the highlight of the film. Once they accomplish their ""time heist"" the punching begins. Then the punching continues. Then it's followed by more punching. More Avengers join in the punching. Much CGI nonsense follows. Capitan America gets a scrape on his face, the only part of him that seems susceptible to damage. Everyone carries the magic glove around while, yes, more punching follows.Finally, when they run out of punches, Iron Man snaps his fingers and it all stops. Tears are shed and the viewer is left asking why this mess couldn't take about two hours less than it did. Overall, I give it a seven for the time travel, take away three for the endless punch fest and two more for the fact that the whole thing is stupid-absurd. It's a great film to watch on a plane where you can skip through most of it.",0

The entire movie I was wondering: What the hell is going on now... Maybe it could have saved the movie if they had cut down on the cost of the special effects and payed for a decent manuscript. Who knows. Another thought... Why can anyone but Thor carry mjølner? If anyone find these magic stones please undo this movie. Thanks.,0

Well, if in the cinema I was waiting something great, second time I'm knew there's nothing. Some sad scenes and dramatic tear-jerking, dear directors, are you serious? It's super hero movie not a drama come-on! Directors of this movie attempted to create Santa Barbara. Action scenes very poor like in low budget movies. There's no some great Iron Man's suit regeneration, or other new features. Just couple seconds of poor action with Tony Stark awaits you.

313,"Everything that could go wrong went wrong. We've had countless time travel movies before, but this one had the worst mechanics by far...and by mechanics I mean there were no mechanics whatsoever. Time travel could no whatever you wanted to as long as it helped the plot advance even if it did not make any sense and came without any consequences. 1 hour into the movie there were already so many loopholes and inconsistencies that I stopped counting. Thanos turned from a lion into a kitten (to avoid saying another word) and your typical evil character. It was so bad that it actually got me laughing when Tony Stark was dying...now that's an achievement on its own. So much time was spent around our protagonists and yet they never felt as thin as they did now. Infinity War was a much much more satisfying movie. Never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather watch Batman Vs Superman over this crap. Now all that I hope for is that it does not break Avatar's box office record or else that would be the joke of the century. Don't get me wrong though, I still highly recommend watching it....for all those below the age of 12...because that's how immature you must be to ignore all of the movie's flaws.",0

I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.

Also, I believe that someone sat down and said lets find a way to ruin every character that we have spent the past 11 years building up and making people love them.

What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again.",0

In fact, there were so many heroes that my head almost went dizzy, I was expecting someone like Mr. Spongebob or Tom and Jerry to appear at any moment. Maybe it could actually make the movie a little less boring. The plot was so ridiculous, so embarassing... Same flat jokes, same senseless pathos from all the previous parts, and ZERO logic. They figured out they needed to travel in time, went to Stark, he said its impossible, blah blah... then he sat down for one evening, had another dull sentimental dialogue with his wife and guess what - he made a time machine in one day. Yep. (Oh, and at the same time he also made the exact copy of Cap. America's shield. So basically, if the only special thing about Cap. America became casual, what is even the point of that character's existence?)

If in a room full of 500 Marvel fans, only 5 persons laugh at the fat jokes, then you must ask yourself if it was really necessary. Because yeah, Thor, grieving and hopeless, became fat and... THAT WAS THE JOKE! Tony, almost a skeleton, inspires sympathies, but Thor, who is fat, is a joke. He's fat! That's the actual joke! WTF Russos?? The time travel doesn't make any sense. At all. No matter how many times it's repeated throughout the movie, it simply doesn't. Can we also talk about Captain America whose character evolution went downhill? Bruce Banner with the body of the Hulk is... I just don't have words anymore. I give up. It was a terrible movie, filled with plot holes and regressive character dev.

If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, you might want to watch that first before Endgame. After you've seen Infinity War, you're gonna love Endgame even better. Yes, some of the Avengers lives are lost, including Tony Stark's, but this 3 hour movie is a great and perfect for the very last avengers movie. I would recommend it. I think it's still playing in certain theaters, so if your theater is playing it, why not give it a try? It may be a really long movie, but they needed tell the entire story after 1/2 of the world population was lost. This basically tells it all. Thanos eventually gets killed in the end, and everyone returns for one last fight.

The small point that if gamora never made the choice due to the time travel, then in fact none of the events in the previous could never have happened as Thanos would have been one stone short seems to be ignored.

409,"Okay so I've loved most of the Marvel films leading up to this final phase, great, i loved Infinity War.So watching this film for the first time was okay, because the old characters coming back and so on is cool once only, after watching the film again i was really bored, like really bored until the end fight.So for me this film was literally 2 hours and 30 mins of talking and stumbling around not doing much then followed by a Infinity War style fight scene which yes was cool but nothing special for the end of this phase.But the main point i want to get across is how much was wrong with this film, there is so many things wrong, I'm not gonna sit here and type 10,000 words to bore you with so all i say is go onto YouTube or Google and lookup ""Things wrong with End Game' and i guarantee you will change your mind about this film, you will reliase that not much makes sense and you will then be sad that this film was the end.Even my friends thought it was good at first, they gave it a 10/10 but after they picked the film apart they even saw how bad it really is.Age 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 3D Double Bill Infinity War + End Game Watch, Consider, Avoid - Watch because its a Marvel film and the last one but avoid once you have seen it once or as a stand alone film.",0

Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies.

Only reason I gave it 3 stars is cause of Jeremy Renner. Great performance. And the graphics were good. Except Thanos. Still looks like he was hand drawn in at the last minute. Just like in infinity.

455,"I realise that I'm in the minority, here, but I walked out of this...this thing really, really angry. Oh, it's a spectacle, to be sure, but an empty one. To each their own, and more power to you if you enjoyed the film, but I couldn't. Why? A number of reasons. It'll be wordy, but at least you can see why exactly I only gave it a three-star-rating - and this is coming from a person who mostly reviews things she loves. Anyway, here goes. First, characterisation. Oh, boy. Let's start with a spiteful nit-pick. Those kept piling up, which is why I mention it. The Asgardians. I have a question, writers: why are the Asgardians fishermen now? Seriously, what gives? Asgard was a highly developed society with technology so advanced, it looked like magic. They had Star-Trek-esque power shields. They had hovercraft. They are not fishermen. Is that because of Norway? Not everyone fishes there, either and also, Asgardians are not Norwegians. It's like if you live close to a river and you specialise in engineering energy shields, someone suddenly pushes you into a boat, and goes: ""Fish!!!!"" Sorry, but no. Then, there's the real problem: Fat Bumbling Thor. What was that? No, seriously. What was that? That's not Thor. That drunken, stoned, lardy, snickering, obnoxious fool is not Thor. Remember the first movie? Where he was a bit of an impulsive, boisterous tool but still overall noble, courageous, selfless, and cultured? The Thor who created some situational comedy without turning into a pitiable punchline? That's Thor. Character derailment for the sake of komedy is not funny, nor is it excusable. It's just bad writing. It's gimmicky and I hate it. Don't even get me started on how Nebula kills her past self without consequences or how years of character development for Gamora get wiped away. Awesome, that. Top notch. The other characters don't fare all that well, either. What was it with Tony suddenly being ""tired and finally ready to rest"" or whatever (paraphrasing, here)? Since when? And Steve staying in the past and playing houseboy whilst Hydra run rampant and his best buddy gets tortured is maybe the worst bit of pathetic ""happy ending"" I've ever come across with. That's not something he would do. If he had a shot at saving Bucky in the past, he would. He wouldn't be this selfish. I also wonder how exactly that worked in everyday life. What did he do all day? The dishes? Peggy's life would be drastically different with Steve around. None of the future events would have happened, and there is simply no handwaving this away or ignoring it. The reason I'm harping on all these details is that added together, they just don't make sense. Everything is just off, and we're supposed to just go along with it like it doesn't reek of sloppily put-together, bad fanfiction? No. No, thanks. I'll pass. That's all bad enough, but then, the plot kicks in, and boy howdy, is it a doozy. Now, I realise that time travel stories need to be taken with a healthy heap of salt (pun unintentional but fitting), yes, but I guess it's the entire package that made me so mad. It's the cavalier attitude, the nonsense, the lack of intelligence, the lack of logic, and all the la-dee-dah accompanying it. First of all, there's the ""oh, it's not like in Terminator and Star Trek"". What is it like, then? If I travel into the past, it's my future? Okay, so riddle me this: if someone goes to the past and kills their past self, then they're still dead in the future and will, therefore, never travel into the past. That's a head-scratcher, but how does the movie deal with it? TERMINATOR WAS WRONG!!!!!! HEY, LOOK, SHINY CARKEYS!!!! That's pretty much it. It doesn't make sense on even the most basic level. Even on first viewing, when we're supposed to just cackle at Fat Bumbling Thor and gawp at the big explosions, the whole plot simply falls apart. Cause and effect are a thing. If someone cuts off my finger in 1999, I'll still be Frodo in 2019. You can't just go THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, make a wannabe-snarky quip, and then movie on to the next hilarious hijinks. What outrageous thing will Fat Bumbling Thor do next? How much more amusing will this light-hearted version of the Hulk be (never mind how all his problems just got magically solved for the sake of hurr-hurr-funny). And how exactly did Steve get the MacGuffins back to the exact same moment in time? That's just virtually impossible, because there were always people around. Take the glowstick of destiny, for instance. Hail Hydra? Okay, so that means that Winter Soldier etc. didn't happen. Nothing past those movies happened, because how - how - did Steve get that thing back without anyone seeing him? There were people around at all times (even Howard Stark in the 1970s). How did he get the ether back to Jane? Did he sneak up on her? Even if, she would have noticed, and that would have changed everything. What about Natasha? How did that pan out? The lol-I-kill-me-first scene, and then Steve shows up and it's all hunky-dory? Why is she still dead? If it never happened, then she shouldn't be dead. But I guess the movie told me her death is final, so it's all good. Tell me, movie, don't show. I don't need sense or logic. It was in the script, so it must be true. And what about Loki? Not only did he (as per the rules of the movie) create an alternate timeline by stealing the Tesseract, but he's gone now from the main one, isn't he? And none of these taking-away-bringing-back gigs affected the other events occurring simultaneously in the MCU timeline? How? The scenes went on for too long, too, especially the ""comedic"" ones. The one relatively in the beginning, with Scott and Bruce and those kids...yikes. It went on forever. The joke wasn't that clever or amusing in the first place, and it overstayed its welcome like nobody's business. And they kept doing that over and over (o hai Fat Bumbling Thor). Sigh. The problem is that all these logic failings, the bad characterisation, and the shucks-ain't-we-clever-thinking-is-for-dopes instants pile up. The movie feels like a clip show: a bunch of komedy or action sketches sewn together, written by folks who think their audience has the attention span of a tomato. That's the worst part. The lack of effort to tell a coherent story. Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to feel sad when Tony bit it? Because I didn't care. It just made me angry. I'm only giving it three stars because the effects were shiny and it's not the actors' fault.",0

457,"There are so many flaws to this film that I hardly know where to begin, and they all spawn in the writers' and directors' lack of cohesive storytelling ability. They do not understand the back stories to each character, they are unable to write love stories, and they try to pander to too many crowds at once.My main beef is Steve's ending. He would never act the way he did, ever.In Captain America: Winter Soldier, Steve's conversation with Peggy depicts him realising that she has lived a full life (with her husband and children), and she encourages him to live his. In the TV series Agent Carter, Peggy develops a relationship with Daniel Sousa, her husband-to-be. They tried so hard to push the Steve and Peggy romance, with a picture of Steve on Peggy's desk at SHIELD HQ, but where were the photos of her family? Why was the desk otherwise completely blank?? Feeble, too little, and too late.Steve knew Peggy married Daniel, so why would the writers and directors think it a good idea to turn Steve into a time travelling homewrecker? That's disgusting enough in itself, but when you add the fact that the directors also stated in an interview after Endgame's release, that Steve would save his frozen self and then his two selves would ""take turns"" with Peggy (while knowingly abandoning Bucky to the torture of Hydra), and you have a new definition of ""tasteless"".But let's say you're OK with Steve acting completely out of character, the time travelling still doesn't make sense. In the film, Bruce explains that changes made in the past does not affect the present, but instead creates an alternate timeline. They make a big deal of explaining it, ridiculing Back to the Future in the progress, so why is it that Steve shows up as an old man on the bench at the end? If he chose to remain in the past, according to Bruce's explanation he should not have shown up in the ppreset, but in an alternate timeline. The only way he could've shown up in the original timeline is if he used time travel, which he did not (or he'd be standing on the platform).It's such a gigantic plot hole, I can't believe people don't realise it. Horrible film, 0/10. Final note: to the people who support the film and say Steve ""deserved a good ending"", what about Peggy and her family? Did they deserve to be wiped out? Steve had no right to erase those children from existence.",0

477,"I loved this movie. I think its the best movie in Cinematic history. Clearly the best MCU movie.About the movie. A culmination of 21 movies going back 11 years. Staring pretty much everyone. The best actors of our generation. Thanos the evil Mad-titan obsessed with collecting all Infinity stones: Soul Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone and Mind Stone. Thanos defeated our heroes, wiped out half of all life in the universe and escaped. This movie is about the result of that defeat and how our heroes will respond.Why the movie is great: The reason this movie is great is because it's the pinnacle on top of all the other movies in the MCU. It takes clues, places people and stories from all the other movies. You get to see the real human toll on the characters from their defeat. The defeat really wounded them and you get to see that. This makes the film more emotional, real and not disposable. The three act break down like this - First Act - The aftermath of Infinity War, Act 2 - Time Heist, and Act 3. Final Battle. The movie is interesting, mind bending, nostalgic, smart, funny, emotional, entertaining, at times violent, epic and in the end the most satisfy conclusion you could possible get from a movie experience. Watch this movie and you will realized you watched something that will never be replicated again. Maybe not even by the MCU. This not even Movie Magic - it's Movie Sorcery. What Marvel crafted here is nothing short of amazing. It's a movie anyone can enjoy. No matter who you are or where you are. Young, Middle aged, old. Every denomination. If you watch this movie be prepared to cry. Don't bring tissues, bring a towel, a beach towel.",1

479,"I am a long time fan of the MCU. I had a lot expectations going into this film. But Avengers: Endgame was a complete letdown. It was very hard to live up to the hype that the movie generated. But it could've been done in a much, much better wayI'll start off with what was good in the movie. The technical details were amazing, in true Marvel fashion. The background score and visual effects were almost flawless. It started off well, with good pacing, and the final battle scene was really well done. There were a lot of moments, especially during the time travel portion of the movie, which pay tribute to 11 years of Marvel films and it genuinely shows us the legacy that Marvel created.That brings me to the bad parts. Endgame seemed to be dedicated to these moments. As nostalgia invoking as these moments are, they do absolutely nothing to further the plot of the movie. I also felt that the tone was too humorous for a movie about people dealing with heavy loss and defeat. The time travel rules of Endgame, which creates an alternate reality rather than affecting the main timeline, felt a little too convenient as it prevents their actions in the past from having any effect on the present. The movie got a little slow in the beginning and I was bored during this portion. I have never been bored watching a Marvel movie and this says something about the epic conclusion to the Infinity saga. But the pace picks up during the time travel portion.Coming to characterisation, Tony Stark was the only character who had a proper arc. His relationship with his family along with the amazing performance by Robert Downey Jr. made his ending all the more heartbreaking. Steve Rogers strapping on his broken shield and standing up to Thanos in his 'I can do this all day' manner was a reminder of why we love him. But his ending was forced and completely betrayed his character. Even Chris Evans' performance (honestly I can't even imagine anyone else playing Captain America) cannot save Steve Rogers from bad writing. We have seen him say goodbye to Peggy in Civil War. And after five or so movies of not even mentioning her, Peggy is his only way for a happy ending? This is a complete disservice to Peggy's character which was developed in Agent Carter. We see Steve pining after his long lost love rather than mourning his friends whom he lost in the snap. This completely discredits the relationships he formed in the 21st century and his relationship with Bucky. Thor was shown to be completely depressed and lonely. After what he has been through, this is completely justified. But he contributes nothing to the team despite being one of the original six Avengers and the fat jokes started becoming distasteful after a while. He was a well loved character among the fans and the writers didn't even give him a proper conclusion. Natasha's character was treated horribly. Hell, she didn't even get a proper funeral. Hawkeye having a family helps us connect more with his character. But that's all his character has got going for him. Professor Hulk felt kind of bland. I missed his trademark anger which was portrayed so well in the previous movies. Nebula, Rocket, Scott Lang and Rhodey had pretty good characters despite not having much of an arc. The female characters (besides Natasha) didn't have much importance to the story and I felt that the final showdown with all the female characters was put there as a part of a political statement more than anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love strong female characters. But spending a whole movie without giving them enough screen time and then showing a badass 2 minute sequence with all of them is not female representation. Even Captain Marvel, being one of the strongest heroes, had very less screen time. And finally coming to Thanos. Thanos was a nuanced, relatable and, at some points, reasonable villain in Infinity War. But all that character development regresses in Endgame. In Endgame he is presented as a generic villain who is evil just for the sake of being evil.Endgame had its moments, but as the epic finale to which 22 movies have been leading up to, it is a complete letdown. Given, that to make a movie with proper characterisation and character arcs for so many characters in under 3 hours is a hard feat to attempt, but we have seen Marvel do it before with Infinity War. Endgame was all lazy writing and cheap fan service. It could have been the epic conclusion, the fans and the characters deserved but it ended up being a huge mess of wasted potential.",0

But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future",0

At least it appeared that way to me. The only thing the infinity stones did was give him the ability to wipe out anyone and everyone with a snap of the fingers.Captain Marvel was useless.It almost made it seem like the guys were incompetent until the woman showed up. Then we had the Power Girls convention for a few moments in the middle of the battle with hundreds or thousands coming at them.Biggest waste of my money ever.",0

Be advised we have watched all of the other Marvel movies, and have begun watching them over again with our children, and we feel totally disappointed with this last installment. I could go on forever on how it doesn't make any sense and is so disjointed... Spoilers ahead. 1. Why were there no paradoxes with the amount of interaction Thor had with his mom, Tony Stark had with his dad, and Captain America had with himself? Even Nebula met herself and then killed herself...Why didn't it impact or change anything in the future? 2. How come Tony Starks' daughter still exists if Thanos didn't get a chance to kill everyone in the first place? Wouldn't that negate the other off shoot time period? 3. How come Gamora was alive for a moment,(she lost her life due to Thanos in Infinity War) but Black Widow (who lost her life as a part of the same ritual)was dead dead? Never to return again?Other troubles:4. How come selfish Hawkeye gets a happy ending with his family after he killed his friend, and also went on a killing rampage prior to getting everything back? 5. Why did they ruin Thor and Hulk? They made Hulk the ""smart hulk"". He was straight up annoying. Thor was plain out childish. Why does the chosen ruler of Asgard, choose not to rule Asgard, and instead gives the job to Valkyrie, if not to merely push the feminine agenda and female power movement we are currently in? 6. Why did they make all the females go up against the army, alone at one point during the battle without males? Again, it felt like a commercial. 7. Assuming Captain America stayed in the past implies that there are two Captain America's in that same timeline. Eventually, it would cross over to the time when Captain America unfreezes. This would imply he is living his life in secret with Agent Carter, but then that doesn't make sense, because the old Captain America ends up on that bench in the ending timeline in an old man's jacket. 8. How come Captain Marvel doesn't age? She has been the same age since the 1990's. This wasn't explained in the movie. Although not a big concern, but something to note. 9. How come all the characters had no depth to them whatsoever, even those we have come to know and love? They were all one note and disjointed. None of them acted in the same way they had in previous movies. There are many more plot holes and disappointing elements, but these are the ones that primarily stood out. I realize it has been explained away by saying there are multiple timelines, however the multiple timelines argument, will not give me back the three hours we wasted by watching this movie. We really hoped it would get better as time went on, only to find out it was about to get worse. So disappointing!! A big let down.",0

(iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses.",0

542,"333. Avengers: Endgame. After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules. Filmbufftim on FB.",1

Not to mention the huge plot holes in the film in regards to the time travelling aspect of it all, an example being Steve Rogers deciding to stay in the past with his love interest. If you also remove all the super powers from this film all you're left with is a terribly written story where the viewer travels back to the last decade of films pumped out by Marvel Studios.

All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000's superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time.

I got to the point where it was so painful I made a conscious decision to rather have a sleep that to endure the dreadful plot and weak representation of our much loved hero's. We were lied to at the end of Infinity War. When Fury drops his pager and calls for Captain Marvel, we did not know she was would be accompanied by Major Disappointment.

I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.,0

571,"I don't even know where to begin on this dumpster fire of a movie. It really made me emotional. Not because it's sad but because I'm in disbelief that I live in a world where this horrible thing not only exists, but is also the most profitable movie of all time. It was really hard to get through this movie because of how insufferably boring it was.I guess I'll start from the beginning:The first hour of this movie is so irrelevant that if you removed it, the plot would not be effected at all. I sat there for 64 minutes (yes, I was counting) WAITING for something interesting or exciting to happen.Hawkeye is literally a disgrace. In many ways. The fact he became a crazy murderous assassin and the Avengers knew about it the whole time but ignored it for years, the fact he's not deaf like his character should be (although that doesn't relate to this specific movie so it didn't effect my rating), and the fact that his character didn't die instead of Nat's.That whole ""No! If anyone's gonna die here, it's ME!"" ""No, I'm gonna die!"" ""SURPRISE, it's ME that's dying!"" fight they had was fun and stuff but we all know that he was the one who really deserved to die and the fact he didn't is anger-inducing to say the least.Thor is another disgrace. I usually love Thor and they turned him into a joke for everyone to make fun of. Is this how they treat depression and PTSD? Fat jokes and fortnite? Really? Did a 12 year old write this script? I'm not even going to get into the travesty that is their ""Hulk"".And on a slightly different note, I'm mad that they found some way to bring Gamora back and yet they couldn't be bothered to revive Loki, a literal god who has died many times before, back to life. What?!?! And yes, this effected my rating because Loki is an iconic antihero and he DESERVED to be in this movie to help them fight Thanos.Small thing that upset me but not enough to effect my rating: Tony not being more upset about losing Peter. It took him awhile to agree to the time travel thing which I understand because he was worried for his daughter, but he also has a SON. Peter literally treats him like a father and this man had the audacity to say ""hmm, maybe we shouldn't"" while cleaning off a picture of them together that he had FRAMED inside his house?Speaking of Peter, he's the only reason I agreed to watch this movie and he shows up 2 hours and 17 minutes into it. That being said, the part where Tony and Peter reunite and they hug and Peter is like ""oh, this is nice"", was the single greatest part of the movie for me and is the entire reason that I rated this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.Finally, what is with that time jump thing? So, it doesn't get reversed and all the disappeared have been missing for 5 years. How old is Peter then?! I know his body is still 16 but for all intents and purposes he's technically 21 now, right? He's still in high school at 21? Can he drink alcohol if his legal age is 21 but he's physically only 16? Like if he shows his ID, it'll say he's 21 right? How does this time jump fit into the Marvel universe and how do they work around it? These are the questions I have and there are many.My final rating is 3/10, like I mentioned, specifically because of the Tony and Peter hug. But also for Tom Holland because he did such a great job in the five seconds of screentime he got. He's truly the best Spiderman yet.I didn't want to watch this movie at all but was convinced. I wish I had listened to my gut and never watched it because I wasted three hours of my life.",0

I would have been happier if they'd made no end game movie and just left things open ended after infinity war. I felt the same disappointment after watching a DC movie, and marvel seemed to be the only hope left with super hero movies, and this sadly proved me wrong. They wasted so much time on going back in time with the infinity stooges and going into boring time lines and not enough time filling in blanks and expanding more on the characters we loved the same way they did in IW. It's sad this is how all these years of movies was wrapped up. What a disgrace. I actually left the theatre angry. I don't agree with how they left things with Thor, it doesn't line up with his character at all.

604,"I don't understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It's almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don't understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself ""if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing"" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE. The other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy's relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time. The last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It's almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble. Other problem with the movie: 1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield 2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it. 3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF 4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out 5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity",0
605, Predictable movie ,0
606,"As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior ""Infinity War"". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie.",0

612,Are those people who rated this higher than a four suffering from cognitive dissonance? It seems you all allowed the hype to inect your thinking and judgement. This is in my opinion the worse film in the Marvel universe series followed by civil war. To many characters a (story) so so lazy that wasonly written to try and tie the strands of the universe together. The film is at least 1 whole hour to long and is frankly boring. Disney are in danger of destroying this franchise like they have ruined the star wars saga. Why have they ruined the hulk who is now a cuddly bubbling idiot with everything that made him one of the most loved characters stripped from him. Even the set pieces are so so nothing different nothing original. People on here need to start telling the truth because a rating averaging 8.6 is simply a lie. Go watch it and review it without society's cognitive dissonance about this film running through your brains. 4/10 the worse in the series.,0
613,"What a waste of 3 hours. Too long, boring and ridiculous.",0
614,"All the hype and then we had a very bad movie, Infinity War was a great build up for Endgame but the approach was so so bad, time travel to save the dead was a very bad move, so no drama and the end couldn't save the movie, and I'm still wondering why all the hype over Captain Marvel and at the end she was useless?..... Well 2 is more than enough for this mess",0

And the other fact is that Marvel just wanted to make money however they could do something more impression.I have to admit that the special effects were fantastic and the movie was really funny to watch.",1
625,"To be fair, it would be tough to top Infinity War, but was this seriously the best script they could come up with? The time travel trope was played out two decades ago, so why rehash it again? No idea, but the studio reheated some ""Back to the Future"" left-overs and went for the lowest hanging fruit on the tree.Okay, so now Stark and cohorts are going to fix is all by going back in time and ""pre-stealing"" the infinity stones then politely returning them the instant they were stolen to begin with presumably to ""not effect"" the timeline. Except, they already affected it when Loki ran off with the Tesseract when they bungled the first attempt. So what came of that? A giant, gaping plot hole is what.The whole sequence exists simply to remind the audience that Captain America still hasn't gotten over his first love, who by the way is about 60 years old at the time they visit, but she looks just the same. And flat attempt to make the audience feel empathy for Stark as he engages with his father commiserating on parenthood which is conveniently placed before he dies.Finally, the culmination of the Avenger's time travelling hi-jinks come to fruition when one of the smartest guys around, Banner-Hulk, puts it on and makes a wish. What does he wish for? To undo Thanos' eradication of 50% of the life in the universe. Makes sense right? But he's supposed to be a genius. Wouldn't a better wish be: Thanos was never born? Way more lives saved that way. But why didn't he? Plot There was a need to send Tony off with a heroes death which fell flat.So, to save Hawkeye, Future Nebula kills her past self with no apparent effect. If you died in the past wouldn't you cease to be in the future? Simple logic. Never mind, this movie jumped the logic rails shortly after title splash rolled.Ultimately, the movie plays like a Michael Bay boom fest and that's all it really has going for it. The script is cringe worthy and written with one goal in mind: To give the actors whose contracts were up, a way out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Technically the movie is superior, but the writing is rubbish.",0

The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",0
653,"Ok so first off the bat.. I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy. Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me. But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros. I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting. Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films.. It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off..Sadly that's what I got from watching this. The first hour was terrible. Spoilers potentially! It gets better in the second half for a while. The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however.. I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film. It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because... It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)? I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me. I really don't get it. So many plot holes and WTF moments? It's just all so wooden.. Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable. The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly. Half of the planets population is wiped out by badguy. Avengers just sit around and wise crack at each other like it's just another day and another baddie to get.?! It's just silly. So so silly.",0

660,"This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all. The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney. They are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.I'd like to say that we as Marvel fan's have been strapped in a chair. We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands. They then proceed to, one by one, spoom feed us things like ""This movie is a masterpiece."" ""The reason why that didn't make sense is because we forgot to put it in."" "" We're so talented. Please waste your money on our talentless, bland films that we only make to make toys, merch and statues that people pay thousands of dollars for."" "" We haven't completely checked out and are desperate for new talent."" As you slowly lose conscience and black out.If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did, rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying nor is it worth watching more than once as some people have. To those people, I pray that your brain's get better >¤<",0
661, What a waste of 3 hours of my life! ,0
662,"...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel.",0

Cap being worthy of mjolnirBad things about this movie: .... pretty much everything that isn't stated above. Like,... 1. Story (Generic superhero stuff, nothing special about this movie. Relies heavily on the nostalgia factor) 2. Plot (It has so many plot holes that if I try to write them all down, it would take me a whole day to get through. Everything that is directly or indirectly related to time travel in this movie is just so wrong) 3. Character development (I didn't say characters, I said character development. Please try to understand the difference. Steve and Tony don't go through any permanent physical or psychological transformation until the very end. Fat Thor sucks in this movie. It's as lame as Nick Fury losing his eye to cat scratch. That's just unforgivable. I'm okay with professor hulk though) 4. Jokes (This movie should not have most of those jokes. That just ruins the seriousness and desperation of avengers' mission) 5. Social commentary (probably because of my own biased view on some issues) 6. Supporting characters (boring. Used only for exposition or quipping unfunny jokes in a serious situation) 7. Logical explanation of time travel theory ( I hate the fact that changing the past doesn't change the future. It just takes away the stakes that this movie is supposed to have. It's one of the worst example of lazy writing since The Last Jedi) 8. Tension building ( we already Know that Avengers will win because it's the final movie in the MCU. There was no creativity to how the avengers defeated Thanos. Iron Man builds a gauntlet that can snatch the stones from other gauntlets and harness it's powers. It was so lame) 9. Captain Marvel ( How can she breathe in space without her helmet that she wore in her solo movie? Was that just for show? Is she like Zombie Superman Princess Leia from The Last Jedi? I'm really glad that Tree Larson with her wooden plank face got less than 15 minutes of screen time) 10. Rescue (How and when did Pepper Potts learn to use the Rescue suit? ) 11. Valkyrie (Where did Valkyrie got her Pegasus from? Weren't they all killed by Hela in Ragnarok? And why did Thor make her the queen of Asgardians? What makes her a worthy leader? They never showed us why she would be a better leader than Thor. When we first saw Valkyrie in Ragnarok, she was more depressed and broken down than Thor in Endgame. At least Thor didn't give up on his people like she did in her first movie) 12. Gamora (what was the point of showing little gamora and Thanos scene at the end of infinity war? Now gamora being her past self and not having any chemistry with the guardians ruins her character arc in previous two Guardians of the Galaxy movies) 13. Thanos (In infinity war Thanos was a menacing yet sympathetic villain, but in Endgame he's just another boring forgettable generic MCU villain like Malekith from The Dark World. It was a massive let down) Spiderman (He's just a coward now. In infinity war he was brave enough to take on black order and not listening to Tony. He even defeated Ebony Maw using his brain and saved Doctor Strange's life. Now he just hides behind women's back, among them some have less experience in fighting than him) 14. Time travel suit (if time travel can't be done without quantum realm suits, how the hell did Thanos brought his whole army and himself into the future without such suits? They never showed us Ebony Maw using Pym particles for creating time machine. 15. Nebula (I wanted nebula to have more important role than she got. She's got a lot of screen time. But the interaction she has with other characters, except the ones with Tony in space, are kind of stupid and predictable) 16. The Ancient one (In doctor strange 2016 she was hesitant to teach strange because she thought he too would end up like keicillius. But in this movie which takes place in 2012 timeline, she is saying that strange is supposed to be the best among them. If that wasn't stupid enough, then just think how the hell did she know that strange would be the best sorcerer when she said that she can't see past her own death in 2016, and she died in that movie before strange defeated doormammu) 17. Mantis (what is her purpose in this movie? When all female MCU character came together to defeat Thanos, she just gave an awkward pose. That's it) 18. Hawkeye ( The whole thing in Japan didn't make sense to me. Like, what is he even doing there and why? How did Natasha find him? What happened to the spaceship that rocket gave him before time travel? Why didn't he use that in final battle against Thanos?) 19. Black widow ( she did not have a character arc like most other avengers. She's just there to sacrifice herself for the soul stone. It would have been more emotional if they had build up her relationship with Clint in a meaningful way instead of teasing about some Budapest incident audience know nothing about in Two movies and not showing us anything. In infinity war Gamora's death was tragic because they had shown us the father-daughter relationship between her and Thanos and how they care for one another. We didn't get that with Clint and Natasha. Her relationship with Cap, Tony and Banner got more screen time and had more depth than with Hawkeye. So, the whole scene in Vormir was not as emotional as Gamora's death in infinity war) 20. Rocket (how the hell did he got the reality stone from Jane? Since we know from Thor 2 that the aether can defend itself from any attacker. Even Odin and the Asgardians couldn't get it out of her body. How did rocket do it? With a taser? How did he turn aether into stone?)........ If I touch the subject of Time travel in this movie, the review would be 10x longer than this. All I can say here is that it's dumb. Seriously, who is giving this film 10 stars?",0

Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.Also, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't.",0
712,"As always this movie had great acting and special effects. I went to the theatre with my friends, sat down with some chips and coke and started watching... Then the movie started it had some suspense at the beginning, then fifteen minutes in, I realised that this movie was more bland than a dish on Kitchen Nightmares, mediocre at best. The only fresh and fun thing was fat Thor. Then the final battle came, and my disappointment continued, the whole MCU came to defend The world against Thanos and his army. And the disappointment continued. Suddenly Capitan America became wordy of Thor's hammer, Capitan Marvel turned into a lesbian, for some reason, Iron man forgot to upgrade his suit, and Loki stole the Tesseract, again, and The Hulk was more useless than Italy in WWII. This movie was worse than GOT season 8! Worse 10 euros ever spend!",0
713,Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.,0
714,"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film.",0

726,"This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible. You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer. It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster. It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews. If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see. I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up. Disney, please don't inflict any more of this garbage on the world.",0

731,"I seriously don't get all the high ratings on this film!! The first hour was a total boring snooze fest (it was like being at a wake). Then there are the logic problems in the movie: 1) Time travel- the movie tells us that they can't go back in time and kill Thanos because that would 'violate the time laws' okay but they can go back and steel the stones, fight with their past selves, and interact with their dead parents??? 2) the society can build a well manicured monument complete with granite engraved names of the missing but CAN'T pick up the garbage all over the streets??? 3) Okay half the people are gone but why are the scenes full of EMPTY streets?? You'll still have people in the cites just half as many. So NYC would go from 1 million plus to 500,000 plus. ect.Anyways for me it was not well written, the acting was flat, and the action was missing. I think Infinity War was 10x better.",0

737,I know there are a lot of hardcore Marvel fans out there but it baffles my brain that this movie gets the praise that it gets. Infinity War was a decent movie but Endgame is pretty bad. Iron Man and Spiderman were great. The Dr. Strange reveal where you realize this is the exact thing he predicted as the only successful way to defeat Thanos was actually pretty darn good. What throws it off is the Disney political correctness. What the actual f*$k was that girl power scene towards the end? It made me so unbelievably un-immersed it is insane. I don't truly believe this is a 1/10 but imma give it a 1/10.,0

743,"Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes. I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes. And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable.

There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch.

I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years.",1

755,"I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney. All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied.",1

758,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies. TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",1

780,"Now here we are at the Endgame. Iron Man said it in Age of Ultron. Dr. Strange in Infinity War. Currently it's the second highest-grossing film of all time, relegating Titanic to third place, and is only $400M away from overtaking Avatar. And it deserves to be right up there, because all three prompted the world to get off of their records and go to the cinema to be a part of a mini cultural movement. I remember when the first Avengers movie was announced, I counted down the days until it was finally shown. Going back further, I remember when I was kid my mom would buy me comic books, most of which were X-men titles but an Avenger one would slip through once in a while. So I really don't like Iron Man because he's too steely, Cap was boring, Black Widow was here then gone, Hawkeye was too arrogant, Hulk was just green and Thor piqued my interest. But when I got a copy of Avengers West Coast, Scarlet Witch mesmerized me and Vision (all white version) got me sold. I mean a witch in love with a robot in the 90s? As an introvert teen trying to find his way in life, these are the people that accompanied me in the tiny corners of a place I'd run and hide to.It's one thing to read about them, it's another to see them alive and moving on the big screen. Or half of them alive anyway. Endgame continues on after the snap, with those left behind trying to continue on after the loss they suffered. If there's one thing negative I can say about the movie, is that the first hour showing the impact of the loss didn't resonate with me. Maybe because I knew beforehand those gone will be brought back and I just have to go through the motions to get to it. Maybe my opinion will change as I watch it again in the future.Now on to the good parts:Final warning, detailed spoilers ahead...1) Captain America wielding Mjolnir (collective gasp from the audience) 2) That shot when Thanos's army was approaching and only Captain America was left standing with a broken shield 3) ""On your left..."" 4) Pepper Potts as Rescue 5) Avengers!....Assemble. 6) Ant man punching an alien ship 7) Spider-man and Iron Man hug. Remember in Homecoming Peter thought they were going to hug and Tony said we're not there yet? They're there now. 8) Passing of the gauntlet from Hawkeye to Captain Marvel 9) Scarlet Witch. The only other Avenger who could've killed Thanos if he didn't get help. 10) Captain Marvel's entry...and short hair...and destroying Thanos's warship single handedly. 11) All female Avengers rescuing Peter. People are divided about this, some saying it felt forced, that it was a little hypocritical but me, I'm here for it. 12) Captain Marvel's one on one with Thanos, that head but and Thanos needing an Infinity Stone to fend her off. 13) Steve coming back to pass on the shield to Sam.What comes next though? How do they top something as big as this? Well there are so many other story lines in the comic book they can translate into the big screen. The actors? Tom, Chad, Benedict and Brie are more than capable of soldiering on. There's also the TV series set for Loki, Bucky and Sam, and Scarlet Witch and Vision. Let's also not forget that Disney now hold the rights to X-Men. So my prediction of still talking about the MCU well way into my 50s is starting to become possible. We might've gotten Endgame, but it seems the game has just begun.",0

The movie was just not memorable at all, but it completed a story, the final nail on the coffin was when all the avengers tried their best against the mighty Thanos only to have sarcastic captain marvel swoop in at the end and boast about how she saved other planets ( even though Thanos killed 50% of everything ) and felt earth was on the last on her todo list. She right their could of snapped Thanos neck like a twig but wanted to make the other avengers feel special as she jetted up and threw her self into battle cruisers like a asteroid. Basically if the avengers would of stayed at home and had Shwama eventally Captain Marvel would of sorted it all out with her infinite power. I felt the rest of the cast were like police officers in a Hero hostage situation, she fly's down pats them on the back and says "" Hey your doing a good job "" only to fly up and handle everything.",0

796,"This is not like the rest, paid for review, this is honest!! As a fan of Captain America since the 80's, I have grown to hate the Avengers movies, this one & Infinity War!!! They have become so unbelievably unbelievable it's pathetic!! This one starts days after Infinity War ends & the ""rescue"" of Iron Man by Disney's new, ultra strong (stronger than a god for Disney) Captain Marvel!! She never existed in any other Avengers movie as people know!! After helping him get home, she basicutakes charge & leads they remaining team to Thanos & guess what, they kill him & Thor is the one that does it with Caption Marvel basically in control of Thanos!!! Then it moves 5 years in the future & they decide to time travel since Ant Man returns & tells them about it!! They get the team back together but find Thor looking like the Dude from the Big Lebowski!!! He is also a drunk & an over weight slob, (this is Disney mind you, supposed to be for kids)!!! They try to get Iron Man but he has a family now & refuses, only to join in as everyone knew he would!! Let's fast forward an hour to they time travel & get the stones with Black Widow giving her own life to get the soul stone!! They get back to headquarters & Hawkeye, who is the main focus for some reason tells them she's dead!! They have a moment of silence & move on like that!! We move to the final hour & the final fight with Thanos from the past. None of the Avengers can handle the gauntlet glove they make & are getting beat, almost get destroyed until Disney's new, stronger than a god Caption Marvel shows up & destroys Thanos ship by herself!! She pretty much takes charge again, beating the crap out of Thanos, not even a god could do what she was doing!! The rest of the ""hero's"" show up that were ""killed"" in the last & tony puts his own life at risk by taking the stones & using them to end Thanos the sameway he used it in the last movie!! It ends with a memorial for Tony & Steve taking the stones back in time to where they belonged in the past, before Thanos got them the first time!! When you think about it, they did not stop Thanos because to do that, they would have needed to kill his mother or killed him right after birth, so think on what will still happen!! There is also no sign of Disney's super duper hero because she is not needed to save the others, including a god!! After Steve put the stones back, he went back to 45 & stayed, only to show up in the 2020's as an old man who is over 100 years old & looks like he's in his 70's!!! You see the screw ups? It starts with the first Iron Man movie!! They put him in modern times & that can't be!! Why you ask, Howard Stark & Tony's mother would be in their 70's by the time Tony is born!! In this movie, Tony goes to 1970 & sees his dad & his dad even mentioned that Tony was not born yet!! Howard, if you know his back story, was working on the Captain America formula for the government in WW1!! That means, he would have been born in the 1890's!!! By not staying with the original material, you get everything out of wack!!! Let's move to Thor, he's a god as I made clear already, that means he is not a mortal & can't die, means he is the most powerful of the Avengers but he can't stop Thanos for nothing & an earthling that is Carol Danvers can handle Thanos like he's nothing? Disney has not only failed with these movies but has ruined Marvel movies that could have been good!! The mindless Disney drones do not want to see these facts & think Disney has done great!! It's past time these movies ended & Disney is removed from everything they are involved with except what Disney started as, a family owned & family oriented company!!!",0

804,"Is the film underwhelming? Yes. It is still good? Yes. With all of the hype i saw on social media and my friend's conversations I had extremely great high hopes for this film however I was left slightly dissatisfied.At 3 hours, the film is way too long and it can drag sometimes, especially in the tedious build up of the first half of the film.Whilst the second half of the film is quicker paced and more enjoyable, including a very well choreographed, action packed end fight scene, I had felt i has seen it all before when thinking about the fight scene in Wakanda in Infinity War and so this wasn't anything special to me. The only thing I did really enjoy about this scene was the return of the fallen soldiers through Dr. Strange's portals. For me, this was one of the best sequences of the entire film.Similarly, the payoff for the culmination of the fight scene- the Avengers defeating Thanos- was anticlimactic. The writers of the film were not going to have the Avengers lose their final outing and so I fully expected this to happen. Contrast this with last year's infinity war, where I was left utterly shocked at the fact the Avengers, who had been built up as an unstoppable force over the previous 2 films, had lost. My jaw was at the floor in the cinema at the time. It was this complete unexpectedness of the climax of Infinity War that makes me believe, however unpopular this may be, that Infinity War was better than Endgame.This film is still however very good. The cast are, as always, great in their roles and the production value is fantastic, which makes for some beautiful looking scenes. All of the jokes (bar Korg playing Fortnite and Hulk dabbing) land, as does equally the action sequences. The addition of new characters in the Avengers series, such as Captain Marvel, are a welcomed addition and inject some fresh blood into the already solid cast, even with their minute amount of screen time (seriously, Captain Marvel had more haircuts than minutes on screen).The plot is solid, although the time travel aspect is confusing at times. Similarly, the plot does open some gaping plot holes. Why are the Guardians of the Galaxy searching for Gamora when they ran into her in the fight scene? (I will admit I'm not a hardcore Marvel fan and so maybe missing something) and how can Captain America suddenly pick up Thor's hammer? (I definitely AM missing something there). Thirdly, there are continuity errors. Thanos tears Iron Man, Captain America and Thor and their respective weaponry apart all at the same time WITHOUT the gauntlet. Thanos is strong, but not that strong.The ending however was the perfect culmination of 22 films over the last 11 years. It tied everything together nicely and gave almost every character a satisfying ending, especially Captain America. Even the end credits with each actors signature were damn beautiful. It didn't bring me to tears but it did make me feel emotional.The Avengers films have been some of my favourite films over the last few years and so to see it end is saddening. This film could have been much better but I am not disappointed with the way the ended it. It really is the end of an era.",1

Then it gets good with the entire battle scene which is completely destroyed by Steve Rogers being a selfish ass! He was my favorite character until this. The writers really F'ed this up.

813,"Just 3 hours of fan service that doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny and doesn't really make sense from an objective standpoint. Obviously all (or most) superhero movies require a suspension of disbelief but they should atleast hold up to their own presumptions. When you start bending the whole narrative structure for some big moments, it just lessens the impact imho. Like for example, some big moments like Grandpa Rogers being there just for the sake of creating an emotional response, even though it massively undermines the character, or the specific choice of 5 years so they can force a 4 year old Morgan into the story for greater emotional impact.I've read a lot of comic books (mostly batman though), and have to hand it to marvel that they have mostly done a better job than DC with the movies, some examples being IW (my favourite MCU movie), Dr. Strange, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther (overrated but still pretty good). Endgame is definitely not in that list, infact so much so that I feel 'Endlame' would've been a more honest and appropriate title.It makes no sense on so many levels, they basically reduced Thanos to a caricature (he had some impact in IW but here he's just a generic evil bad guy who doesn't think much), and time travel is the ultimate cop-out. I could go on with all the flaws and really dumb stuff (how the hell does Laura Barton's cellphone still work 😁, the power levels make no sense, Captain Marvel is conspicuously missing through most of it and why is she not aware of Thanos' genocide across planets etc), but basically the movie was absolute rubbish and takes massive liberties and leaps of logic which the fanboys blindly accept.I've been in the minority when it comes to movies before. I loved the universally panned BvS, though I'll add that the ultimate edition is the only one to watch. Sure it had it's share of silliness like the 'Martha' moment, but that movie got badly burned as a result while none of that seems to be affecting endgame. BvS did try (maybe too hard) to be different, but endgame just comes across as formulaic and deeply flawed.Marvel have at least stayed true to their formula though, while Warner Bros didn't have it in them to stick to the original vision. If they had stuck with Zack Snyder's planned 5-movie arc then we might have got Thanos AND Darkseid in the same year, which might've made both cinematic universes more interesting.",0

There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside.

But all that suit up, training was for time travel to see their younger selves and parents. An 8 year old will be able to write that outline.

844,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'.",0

All the crying and moping and ""we're grieving so hard over here"" was dumb.Cap longingly staring at his girlfriend's picture all of a sudden felt forced.

I get it, girl power! Yay! But it felt so damn forced I rolled me eyes so hard I saw the back of my skull.What made me dislike the movie most was that despite their best attempts at tying loose ends, it felt like lazy writing. Probably because when they wrote the first three movies they didn't have the foresight to drop (or use) Easter eggs that would be found in Endgame. An example is Cap's sudden longing for his girl.I honestly couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Glad I red boxed it.",0
847,"I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired",0

Doctor Strange. If Thanos gets pulled out of the timeline and killed before he could get all the stones. But he can still get to destroy 1/2 of living things in the past? That doesn't make sense.But let's pretend it does and go further...How can Thanos be stronger than any Avengers, and worse, all Avengers at once, without the glove? At least Captain Marvel should be able to kick the hell out of him.Captain Marvel film was great, they introduced this amazing super heroine and she is in what... 5- 10 minutes out of a 3 hour movie?Was she created only to compete with DCs Wonder Woman?Why the hell they transformed Thor in a funny side kick?? Yes, we love Thor's humor but they went too far with the Big Lebowski ""joke"".By the way, what a mess to double the earth's population size after 5 years!And... don't wait for the credits just to listen a bell ringing.This movie is not a worth ending for a series of awesome movies.",1
873,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace.

It gets real boring real fast. Everybody is sad & useless. Guys, we get it, your friends are dead, now stop being sad and start showing some passion to avenge. Hulk has lost its charm of being that wild, mean, funny character. Thor has lost his planet, his people, his brother, his girlfriend, his parents and he has lost his looks with all the charm he was good for. He gave away his throne too in the end. Thor also lost something more precious then all of this....Can you guess what? He lost his place in the Marvel universe. Wanna know how? Directors made sure Thor is not the only one who can call up the hammer when he pleases. Can you imagine anything left for Thor in Marvel universe? I thought so...Captain America can call up Thor's hammer and use it as he pleases. This is the biggest blunder of the Marvel production. Cap has no magical power and he sure as hell is not a God of any place. Trust me when I say this, when captain America call up the hammer by raising his arm up and hammer came to him ""All the sheeps in the theater were clapping"" . They had no idea, they got fooled right in front of their faces. LOLNow lets get to time travel. Its an idea that any Director/writer uses when they have no story, no sense, no passion, and just want to make money by fooling people. Avengers story writers were stuck and didn't know what to do. In time travel you can do anything and change any story you want. NOT FUN AT ALL.Another blunder is that Iron-man dies while he had all the power of the universe in his hands. ""Use common sense"". How can the most powerful person in universe dies? I know how, give the story to Marvel universe and they will manage to kill that person without using any logic and people will believe it.This movie shows iron man an old white haired/bearded guy who lives In the cottage. Very weak, Anxiety filled man. where is that full of life, charming, passionate, avenging iron-man? Long gone after he got married....Marvel universe has changed the meaning of Action movie in to an Emotional movie with 2&1/2 hours of whining out of 3hrs of movie.Avengers: End game genre says its ""Action,Adventure,Fantacy,Sci-fi"" they left a Big part of movie genre ""DRAMA"" I urge the IMDB to get the genre right next time so people know what to expect.Infinity war was the best movie of Marvel and Endgame was the worst.",0

None of the ""demotions"" were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying.

925," 3 hours of movie: 90% a waste of your time and 10% of some good action, that's it ",0
926,"This film has been the build up of 11 years of which 21 movies have structured a saga of enthralling movies to pay off for this one film. And I have to say this movie was amazing. The way the movie starts off shows that this is going to be a wild ride from beginning to end. This film starts off with a reflection of the events of infinity war as we see a take of death like few other superhero movies like no other. The avengers are seen as hopeless as we see the impact of the snap on everyone's lives. When ant man comes in he is clueless of what's going on so he finds the avengers as they start the search for a plan to bring everyone back. The avengers reassemble which is akin to when they assemble the avengers in the 2012 original. It is perfect and reflects the movie as it tends to tribute famous scenes in the mcu there is a clear difference as now they are depressed as a lot of the film shows the characters in peril. They then go to restore the infinity stones and go back in time to get the stones to bring everyone back. And the adventure there is great, most of the films comedy comes from here which is a good way for a break to tension and revisiting these scenes are amazingly nostalgic and easily will bring a smile to the face of anyone who has seen the other films. The 3rd act includes in my opinion the best final battle of any film as the build up to it in this movie let alone is great. Seeing the before fat and drunk Thor revisiting Asgard, captain America vs captain America, tony stark visiting his father and the return to the battle of New York and the start if guardians of the galaxy are amazing scenes with Thor in this movie getting some great scenes as well as nostalgic scenes in tribute to the other films and how they linked them together.The conclusion holds in my opinion the best final battle scene ever in a movie. After hulk snapping his fingers he brings back all the deceased avengers bit not before thanos arrives as he was now here for revenge to get the stones back. A fight ensues as the avengers fight the black order and thanos' army. Thor ,iron man and captain America take on thanos as they again begin to lose but soon as another fan moment captain America picks up thors hammer as hinted at in age of ultron as the audience me included erupted in an applause. I should mention that the action in the film is amazing as people say that there is not to much action and is a bit prolonged with dialogue but the dialogue is essential to the plot as well as dramatic tension. The dialogue is easy to pay attention to and well executed. The action that comes is in long scenes but is done amazingly with fast paced well filmed beautiful cgi. Then after the captain America hammer scene ensues great action but cap and the avengers in peril the words "" on your left cap"" will stay in my head forever as portals opened with all of the heroes coming out Spider-Man black panther scarlet witch doctor strange peter quill and more as they returned in numbers with other armies from there respective films with a army akin to thanos . They stood there in numbers ready for captain America to say the words "" avengers... assemble "" followed by a massive charge with reunions fights and peril with all avengers teaming up in different ways in a scene that still gives me goosebumps today. Finally the ultimate sacrifice from the avengers greatest hero iron man in getting the infinity stones he watches thanos' fear as a response to his line "" I am inevitable "" iron man said ""I am iron man "" the line that capped off the first mcu film iron man as iron man dies with his last words engraved in the audiences minds thanos and his army turn to dust as the avengers mourn the death of the greatest avenger. This is the biggest fan tribute i have ever seen as the movie is on that marvel fans will love 3000 ( sorry for the corny message) but this is one of the greatest blockbusters ever which warrants being the biggest movie of all time. The directors clearly put in years of work for this movie and the movie will leave a legacy on film forever with the clever and well played out deaths of iron man and black widow. This is a must see blockbuster film which warrants all positivity it gets",1

I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't.",0
943,"I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have ""one chance to get it right"" yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule ""as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow ""has to stay dead"" yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far.",0

950,"Unpopular opinion. Let me start by saying that Endgame is not a bad film. In fact it was a decent film. But nothing more. Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype. The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place. Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It's like the writers didn't care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments. Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes. Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this. The last battle was epic and beautiful but that's all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch. Also, the way they ended Cap's story, meh... Yeah we got it, you want to make people cry and give us the end of an era, but at least do it without creating dozens of plot holes. The 3 hours went by fast, but I wouldn't watch it again in theaters (I had planned to watch it at least 1 more time). This could be so damn good... Disappointed.*edit* Also, all of you fanboys who downvote all my reviews because you got angry because I gave your beloved Avengers a 6, you are just amusing and pathetic. Get a life.",0

If I had a power stone I'd pummel the writers heads in for very little action, poor pace and zero explanation of how Captain America single handedly returned all the stones to the exact time and place they were taken. If me or a friend could get the soul stone, I'd jump so I wouldn't have to watch that garbage again. If I had the mind stone, I'd make sure nobody else chose to experience it either.",1

Everyone knew already what was going to happen before this movie came out but it could have been executed much better.Endgame is a total waste of good character development,acting and story. What they did to the Hulk and to Thor was truly unacceptable. The Hulk became some nerdy green giant that doesn't do stupid things and Thor became a very bad drunk guy not to mention that Captain America had the power to hold Thor's hammer al of a sudden? Like what? Killing of heroes is 1 thing, but killing of ironman is totally not needed. Of all those 500 avengers on that battlefield why him? Ironman was 1 of the characters that made this movie a bit interesting.The ending was just weird....This wasn't what I expected after Infinity War. Such a shame.",0

967,"WITHOUT TIME TRAVEL!1. Thanos does not destroy the gauntlet and Thanos does not die immediately at the beginning.2. Redeeming the hate for Captain Marvel: I personally like her character. I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie. That being said they should have brought her in, had character development with the remaining Avengers team, and got to the task of taking on Thanos and reversing what had happened in Infinity War. It could turn out that her power doesn't exceed but matches Thanos' power. Another possibility is that Thanos who finally has all of the Infinity Stones learns of yet more power that the Gauntlet unleashes. So many possibilities really they never even delved into the Gauntlet and what all it could do.3. That being said they could have tackled it numerous ways without the use of time travel, i will put one scenario out there. With the added power that Captain Marvel brings to the team they could take on Thanos, somehow acquire the Time Stone from the Gauntlet and use that to reverse time. Hell they could even have a huge CGI blowout where time is traveling backwards while they are fighting the mighty Thanos. Time reverses until they get back to the point where Infinity War left off. With all Marvel characters present they could have the biggest battle scene a Marvel movie has had to date. One where they tie up the contract issues with the actors and the ones that have to die could have died during the battle. So many variations they could have gone with and made it a much more edge-of-your-seat ride than what they put out, which was mostly boring, filled with plots holes and left me underwhelmed to say the least. I have no plans to re-watch Endgame in the near future, if at all.In conclusion i just wrote this in five minutes on a lazy Sunday afternoon after a week of brooding about how bad Endgame was. Marvel had an entire team of hundreds, probably thousands of people to put out a better product than what we got. It was a cop out film and everyone involved should be embarassed that that was the final product after so many years of building this exciting franchise.",1

977,"Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...",0

996,"This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!",0
997,"So I could go back and stop myself from seeing this film! ""Infinity War"" was a masterpiece compared to this. Marvel please undo the 181 minutes of my life!Earlier we could count at least on some action scenes in Marvel movies. Not today Thanos! There is barely any action in the movie and the CGI they used in fights was extremely low quality and painful to watch. Even some basic fights and tricks were not choreographed by actors but made of a cheap looking, crappy CGI. This is unacceptable for such a budget.The story is so bad even a 5-yo child could write better. Some people are sobbing for AGES (I do understand a pain of loss but come on aren't you called superheroes for a reason?) Other people just appear out of nowhere doing their things with no explanation whatsoever. How in the world did this garbage get 9\10 rating is a mystery. I guess it's a real Endgame...",0

I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all.

1025, Biggest let down in the MCU ,0
1026,"This movie was (like the title suggests) overhyped. Following the events of Infinity War, which was better btw, half of the people on earth are dead. The first hour of the movie just consisted of long silent/not-so-sad/emotional pauses in dialogue that was filled with the main theme of ""its over. Thanos did what he said he'd do. We have to move on and stop crying over it"". Boring. To push this movie into gear, Marvel really scraped the bottom of the barrel. A rat. Yes, a rat is responsible for the events to follow the rat's actions. The ant-man was trapped in another dimension for 5 years and was then brought back because a normal rat stepped on a certain button triggering the return of ant-man along with the idea of time travel. No one in this universe has ever thought of time travel ever. But I digress. On top of this, captain marvel is a bratty super hero who only helps when it's convenient. I waited a full hour and 15 minutes to see the most boring super hero fight another version of himself. That's right, captain america. Everyone's favorite super hero with nuclear steroids. Overall: overhyped, bad storytelling at times, and an unnecessary amount of scenes. My 2 favorite parts were the final battle and black widow's death. Good. An unneeded character with the ability to fight good and shoot perfect. Gee what other super hero has those traits.",0

Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.,0
1028,"A fat Thor and a hippie dippy Hulk? Please. These moviemakers have very little loyalty to the original franchise, and no idea how to transform the persona of the original characters to the big screen. They basically bought the rights to a franchise and then formed the characters the way they wanted in order to tell a story they wanted to tell.Really enjoyed watching ""superheroes"" become mental cases and continually get their buts kicked in battle. How about making Thanos just a little more vulnerable and concluding everything with a good old battle to the end rather than introducing a bunch of sentimental goobly gop?

1035,"This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it.",0
1036,"The bad stuff: Gives closure to an ambitious project. But not really its own movie. Suffers from time travel problems for a movie this big. It really hurts it. Not making good use of this huge cast of characters by making cool unique interactions. Rather they opted to change iconic characters to see them like never before. So, kind of reliving the first Avengers movie, they even prioritized the same core characters.The good stuff: Nice 40 minutes of CGI superhero vs villain fights. Tons of references to the comics.",1

1038,Amazing film The best in the world I watched the movie for more than five times but the end was sad with the death of Iron Man!,1
1039,"I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and honestly, I think I've watched Infinity War over 20 times prior to watching Endgame. I had high expectations for the sequel, and actually thought it would be deeper than it turned out to be. Endgame is intricate, yes. But intricately shallow. Here are some things I thought would happen but didn't. First of all, I counted on every line in Infinity War, thinking it would imply something greater in Endgame.Example 1: When Thanos asked Red Skull ""Where is the Soul Stone?"", Red Skull responded, ""You should know, it extracts a terrible price."" Thanos replied with ""I am prepared,"" and Red Skull said, ""We all think that at first. We are all wrong.""This led me to think that perhaps in Endgame, Thanos regrets his decision to kill Gamora, and somehow the stone would turn on him or doesn't work the way it should because what he did to her was not really love. He selfishly sacrificed her, and true love is putting someone else's needs before your own. Although this part is sort of redeemed in Endgame when Nat sacrificed herself for Clint (to contrast what Thanos did to Gamora), Endgame still should have shown how Thanos was ""wrong"" in thinking that he could let Gamora go if he did truly love her. Doing so would have also added another facet his character. However, in Endgame, Thanos was not the same as he was in Infinity War. He had no conviction and became even more ruthless in his avenging.Example 2: Dr. Strange told Tony Stark ""We're in the endgame now"" and ""there was no other way"" right before he turned to dust.I had high hopes for Dr. Strange and his creative problem-solving skills in Endgame. I thought he had perhaps sent the time stone to the past or future to do some ""work"" prior to handing it over to Thanos. But nope, there was nothing. He handed over the actual stone. There was no manipulation of it. There was also no game plan. Dr. Strange HAD NO PLAN! He basically saw his 14+ million possible outcomes that they would win by some stroke of luck, and bet everything on that one chance (which was a mouse hitting some switches in Ant-Man's time machine van). Wouldn't it have been more intricate if he had sent the stone to the past or future to tamper with time, or to somehow orchestrate events in a way where their winning was more premeditated and planned, than merely by some stroke of luck or some random chance?Example 3 In Infinity War, when Vision offered to die to save half the universe, Captain American told him, ""We don't trade lives Vision"", and Vision said, ""Captain, 70 years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people, tell me why is this any different.""I thought Captain America would be the one who would sacrifice himself in Endgame, perhaps the one to undo the snap. He was the one who previously laid down his life for millions and perhaps he should have done it in Endgame. I'm bummed about a few other things. I couldn't relate to the characters as much as I did in Infinity War. Endgame's characters' interactions felt more scripted and robotic.I wasn't convinced that Morgan was Pepper's daughter. I didn't sense that connection between them. There was no scene of Pepper tending to Morgan in the movie, except for the end when she held Morgan at Tony's funeral. I didn't feel sad at Tony's funeral. Nobody cried there. Yes, he was a true hero, but there should have been some tears. Maybe they all saw that his death was unpreventable, but still, the loss didn't seem emotionally impactful (to me).I really did not like what they did to Thor in Endgame. They stripped him of his dignity. I thought maybe they would redeem him by the movie's end, but they didn't. He was still fat and no longer desired to lead Asgard. Back on the alcoholism road, maybe? Thor also had both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker in Endgame, yet he couldn't even strike Thanos (who had no stones to empower him this time).The melding of Banner and Hulk was underwhelming. It was Hulk's extremity that made him The Hulk. Banner-Hulk may seem like ""the best of both worlds,"" but it made the character too palatable, too compromised, and not exciting or powerful. He wasn't a strong fighter like the Hulk, and he just looked like a green Thanos with glasses. There should have been a Hulk and Thanos rematch to redeem the Hulk at least!Also, how did Captain Marvel come in just the right time at the beginning and the end to help save the day? That end-credit scene in Captain Marvel where she comes back asking ""Where's Fury?"" should have been included in this movie. I also think she should have been included MORE in this movie if she is to be considered an Avenger and a part of the team.And the ending...how did Captain America age after living a ""normal"" life with Peggy? And even if they did marry, wouldn't he still have looked only 40 years old after she had grown old and died? And what if they had kids? Wouldn't their kids run into Peggy's original kids with her previous husband? Confusing and just odd.There were a LOT of superheroes in this movie (especially when the snap was reversed), but they all felt like strangers to me. I could not connect with them, perhaps because there was only so much that could be jam packed in 3 hours.All in all, I thought the movie was good because it was still complex. I loved the action scenes and I enjoyed seeing some characters rekindling with loved ones from their past. However, this movie did fall short in quite a few areas and just wasn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. The time traveling had its own plot holes, and I truly miss Vision and the 2018 Gamora.I think Infinity War was the better movie. Endgame, by itself, was a good standalone movie, but it wasn't well executed as Infinity War's sequel. Even though Infinity War and Endgame had the same sets of writers and directors, it didn't feel that way. The pacing, plot progression, and division of screen time for actors were handled more aptly in Infinity War, in my opinion.",1

Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die.",0

1056,"Spoiler alert, so read at your own risk. I though the latest title couldn't get much worse, until I watched Endgame. Again, a movie that looks like a computer game, this time since the script failed to innovate, it goes back to the previous movies ""Back to the future"" style. A fat Thor playing Fortnite, a Mjornir that any bloke can use, including the strange duck face Captain ""never gets his suit right"" Strangelip. A captain that gets old and delivers his shield to the flying ""never had an impact role"" birdie. An intelligent nerdy Hulk who lost all his grace (a green Mark Ruffalo on steroids and that's it). The list goes on and on, starting slooooow in the beginning to end in the yet again climax of the ""playmobil-bring the action man and all the transformers"" battle in the end, with depressing results and laughable deaths. Bring the wife and put her on an iron man suit, hell bring the smurfs, the ""useless on this flick"" Black Panther and friends, Popeye and your dog if you want. This is trash ""cinema"" in the making. let's skeese the money-cow with poor scripting, terrible CGI and ruin every child's fantasy regarding what is what and whom is whom on the ""Marvel"" universe.

1062,"I thought the Infinity Wars was bad, but this has brought Marvel/Disney to a new low. The idea of going back in time and changing the present is as old as the hills, but it also opens Pandora's Box. It means you can do it again and again. Which negates the foundation of reality. This plot, unlike the last Avenger's movie, relies on pseudo-science instead of the supernatural. I love science fiction, but this was anything but. Spoiler: Stark looking at a Mobius Strip and somehow realizing time travel was possible was painful to watch. So then they go back in time, make everything hunky dory, as it was before Thanos, but Ironman get killed in the process. So not only did Marvel kill off it's number one action hero (at the box office), but it showed the world that nothing bad can ever happen, because we can simply go back in time and make it better. Interesting how all the characters scoffed at the idea as well, before they actually did it. Time travel movies are fun, but only if they can never be repeated. Using it as a plot device to restore everything to as it was before, was just a cheap trick. I would have been more impressed if Dr. strange found a new set of stones and changed everything back. As a Marvel fan from the Silver Age of Marvel (1960s &70s) I wish Disney would have stuck to the comic magazines closer and not tried to bring the Marvel universe to a depressing conclusion.",0
1063,"I didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children.",1
1064,"I was so excited before and so let down afterwards.While Infinity War was better paced and presented Thanos's goal and how he worked to achive it having some philosophy behind, here we are greeted with alot of self pity and ""he hit us, we must kill him"" plot. That's all there is, no deeper meaning. We could also call them Revengers from now on.Unfortunately very quickly in Endgame the revenge mechanism appeared. The oh-so-convenient time travel. Quantum everything and there you go, Endgame solved. Add to that the overall ""our chosen good guys must win"" obvious direction and the suspense or thrill for the movie vanished instantly.Cutting a long story short: Fat Thor was funnyBannerulk looked like an aged man trying to blend his passions with the responsabilitiesNebula should have changed her cloud password :)Disliked Captain Marvel's haircutAlternate timelines selflishly affected in order to achive their revenge. How did they patch the Soul stone or the Tessaract that fell in Loki's hands?!Let's say Captain America got from barely moving Mlornir to easily swinging it because he became more worthy but the lightning thing?! Wasn't Thor the god of lightning not the god of hammers As Odin told him?!. Therefore the lightning was channeled from Thor through Mlornir not from the hammer itself.Fighting power greatly inconsistentFat Thor got so weak with Stormbreaker AND Mlornir to barely fight NG (No Gauntlet) Thanos?!How did NG Thanos expect to attack all heroes at once and let only Nebula look for the stones?!How could Gauntlet Thanos be so weak with the glove on?! I mean he could exit through a portal, get at full strenght and then return to smash them all over again - that's an easy plot hole.Too much plot armor overall for all superheroesThe continuous juggle with the gauntlet that went on and off so easyThanos reduced from a clever driven villan to a generic average bad guyAnyways, that's my impression of the movie. Not sure I will rewatch it like I did so many times with Infinity War. Maybe the other 14M alternate futures got a better story.Over and out.Edit: Lowered the score, changed title and added 2 lines to be more accurate. Reality is often disappointing.",0

It makes no sense what you people did there. Even Superman had his limits, and was vulnerable and felt real, we were glad to accept him as a hero, because he felt like one of us. But she, she is nothing like us, humans, so I just don't get it. Sorry, one star for this nonsensical thing you call Avengers: Endgame.

1082,"I was mostly excited going to see this film when it came out in cinemas, however upon viewing I was quite disappointed.While the action scenes were fun and there were some good laughs throughout, looking back on the film it was 3 hours of my life I will never get back. I was particularly upset with the use of time travel as a cop-out for the snap.I found it a bit self righteous calling out various time-travel films (particularly Back to the Future) for having unrealistic time travel rules when any time travel theories that exist are already paradoxical anyway. Endgame's rules were no exception to this and also were so confusing that the film constantly had to keep breaking them to work. This was not aided by the unnecessarily complicated explanation given by Prof. Hulk.In addition to this, the presence of time travel in the MCU now cheapens any of the sacrifices made in any of the films as the heroes can just go back and pull their friends from an alternate reality (like what they did with Gamora).I was also dissatisfied with the whole premise of the film as being a plot to reverse what was done in the previous film rendering the two movies as pointless. I really enjoyed Infinity War, but found Endgame to be a disservice to the set up it was given.Side note: Though I have seen all of the films except for Hulk, Capt. Marvel and Far From Home, I am not the biggest MCU fan so my opinion may be partially biased as I do quite enjoy poking fun and nitpicking the films (that is my way of enjoying them). However I tried to keep this as respectful and honest as possible by making sure that all the points I have made are my genuine opinions and not just designed to poke fun at the movie or anyone who enjoyed it.So if you enjoyed the film, I totally respect that and am very happy for you.

1087,"Tone, pacing, character arcs, plot holes, emotional connect, logical depth,story, propagandas, Plot convenience, lazy writing.Overrated, overhyped cashgrab. (Plot holes can be justified but the emotions, how one feels about it cannot) Endgame forces us to constantly think outside the box about the writing part. Infinity war is an amazing film but how did they manage to get the first one so right and the second so wrong. It looks like they were just trying to copy DC for having a dark ending but even they give a symbol of hope when Superman dies.Shame, a decade of characters development wasted. ..1. Tony has finally moved on and retired having a family, overcoming his panic attacks and anxiety realizing that he doesn't have to save the world anymore, but there you go the writers decided killing the basic true sense of his arc, putting him at the spot to sacrifice himself again like he was going to in all previous films and giving a dark terrible ending hurting every kid who grew up watching him for a decade, they could have sent him to coma like in the comics at least. Then a deliberate attempt by the writers trying to convince all that it was okay to kill him with the Tony's speech. It felt like they had to do this for the sake of continuing with phase 4 in Mcu to make more money so he had to forcefully die because this is supposed to be ending for all.* also this film is lost in itself lacking emotional depth as it is satisfactory to know that he is alive in many other alternate timelines. Whoever accepts this ending has failed to understand this character because all believe he's selfish man turning into a legend. Yes, this time he had much to loose -a daughter but still he was always selfless when it came to saving world like every other superhero in world at any given moment and he always played the sacrifice game welcoming death because he is that legend indeed. 2. Thor was already ruined enough in Ragnarok but they managed to make him a fat joke. Thor rejects the throne in Dark World so he could learn more and protect Earth. But he accepts the throne in Ragnarok because he feels ready and he needs to, also now he's in his most powerful form to rule. But in this film he rejects the throne once again and gives it to Valkyrie. We have a Hulk who doesn't get enough importance not even a minute of solo fight after he got beaten by Thanos in IW. Then comes Captain Marvel who is said to be the most powerful but doesn't get a proper combat against Thanos and gets defeated within seconds. 3. People expected that Steve Rogers will die so they made him live, here he leaves his best friend Bucky without giving him a purpose after all the journey they've been through and letting him to still be a sidekick where he doesn't get to either retire nor be the next captain as he hands over the shield to Sam. Steve decides to go away to live in the past out of nowhere and does not accept his reality though peggy asked him to move on...he could have done that starting fresh in the present and also be a responsibile support system for future Avengers, retirement done wrong. 4. Thanos who is this guy? he's not our villian who we travelled with in IW. This is just a guy who is saying that he is going to enjoy killing people. The writers here are trying their best to make him look bad with new different ideology because the audience somewhat liked him in IW. He is there for the necessity of a big bad guy in the climax. 5. The final war had one of the greatest moment in cinematic history which is the entrance of all heroes that was fun to watch because it is the basic reason- final biggest superhero team up movie which audience waited to see. After the entrances this turned out to be the worst battle ever where it's all just action without any logic , unwanted humor and forced team up shots. This action flick concludes the ten years of storytelling with a War sequence..whole big battle episode is a disgrace to war scenes of great films where everyone in a war is supposed to be useful.-Being the so called biggest action 3-hour long comicbook event film, we come to a stage just after like 8 mins where everyone is useless without screen time and in the final setup the only one left to face against thanos is again the same Tony Stark who was willing to sacrifice himself for Nth time.-I wish to see the 14 billion ways of Doctor strange which writers failed to work on to make a better film but they chose this because whatever they make because of the hype it was destined to hit big to carry-on the franchise without stopping.A celebration turned into a tragedy.",0

1096,"The movie unsuccessful attempted to get sensual but it was way from it ,it felt like a roller coaster with the sequence of action, too many things happening in a short segment that will throw you off from enjoying the movie , it is too long and that tells you something , too many characters , lol you will get lost, like wow this a way odd. If you decide to watch it avoid the 3D version. Honestly , it was way below my expectations .",0
1097," Excellent production, poor content ",0
1098,"I think I'm done with being a super hype fanboy of the MCU as well, but not for the same reasons as you. I'm not burnt out on superhero movies, I'm not walking off after a grand finale just for the sake of doing so and I'm not letting one character in Captain Marvel end my love for a franchise. Avengers Endgame is what essentially ruined the entire franchise of movies for me. You're probably thinking that I'm severely exaggerating, and to be honest you'd probably be right to think so, but having that lazily-written, poor finale of a movie be the culmination to which TWENTY ONE other movies have lead up to is just despicable in my eyes. I know that statement sounds very emotionally driven, and it is, but it's just part of my disappointment.You don't have to agree with me, you don't even have to read this if you don't want to or don't care, but I just really want to say why I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes' 95% and the over-3000 IMDb users who voted 10/10.After the heart-wrenching set up provided to us in Infinity War by none other than the same Russo Brothers who brought us this lame finale, I had high expectations...EXTREMELY high expectations. But after 21 other movies through ten years set up this movie, I almost feel entitled to those expectations and I stand by them. If you haven't been able to pick up on my blatantly negative tone towards the movie already, it didn't meet those expectations.Let's start with the elephant in the room, the time travel aspect. I'm going to be as outright and as honest as I can possibly be. That was pathetic and disrespectful to Infinity War, I felt personally offended by that story writing (or lack thereof). I get that Marvel movies are far from realistic, but generally, even with all the magical powers and very advanced technology, there is some sort of logical flow that these tend to follow (unlike Once Upon a Time hahaha) and most of the things that happen are explainable (ex. all the magic powers have some sort of understandable explanation/origin). That's a bold statement by me, I know, but I stand by it. Anyways, all that logic was thrown out of the window with time travel. I read a comment that said, ""Time traveling is RARELY done right; when I see time traveling shenanigans that is clearly for plot convenience"". That basically expresses my feelings about time travel, especially in this movie. It is so far from reality that it's almost comprehensible and thus it DOESN'T WORK! Yes, magical gauntlets and infinity stones are far from reality too, but those at least have some kind of constant consistency (well until this movie anyways --> Thanos destroys that which makes up and controls the universe without destroying the universe itself...that's possible?). There is no consistency or logic to time travel. This is what I think of directors saying when I see them using time travel: ""The characters couldn't beat the villain the first time around because they weren't strong enough, so let's just reverse everything and let them try again instead of thinking of a much more creative way of having them ultimately win."" And COME ON, if they're gonna use time travel, AT LEAST use the *Time Stone* instead of some alternate realm where you can apparently navigate both time and space (which Tony figured out in like 2 minutes and we never got a proper explanation on how he did it, because there is no feasible one) to when/wherever you want because your past is your future and your present is your past or whatever, and it is a different length of time than reality and what not. Also, when the Ancient One brought up different realities, I was pulling my hair...like really?Now that I dumped time travel, I want to talk about arguably the most bothersome part of all the movie, the treatment of our beloved characters. I'll discuss the worst ones.Thor: You've gotta be kidding me with this. Let's reflect on the old Thor. In Thor 1, we saw his willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Very selfless and heroic of him (I loved Thor 1 by the way). In Thor 2, we didn't see much other than his power. In Thor 3, we saw his character development to discover his ""true self"" and his extreme perseverance. In Infinity War, he was TRULY a god through holding back a star, almost killing Thanos etc. Now let's get to the new Thor. A drunk depressed wimp. That's a disgraceful ruination of his character.Hulk: I'm kind of tired at this point so I'll keep this short a sweet. A character who was defined by his dual, Dr. Jeckel/Mr. Hyde-like personality (whose other half refused to come out in Infinity War) was turned into one big joke with BARELY an explanation. They took the point of Hulk and threw it out the window. And where's that Hulk-Thanos rematch at?Hawkeye: A man with a great heart (shown through his willingness to sacrifice his life in Age of Ultron) turned into a despicable murderer (and accomplished what by doing it?) because his family was murdered. I didn't like that.Nebula: Killed her past self but she still exists. Niceeeeeeee.Ant Man: Brought out of quantum realm by a convenient rat. Plot convenience really shines here.Props to you if you're still reading this by the way.Plot holes are another glaring issue for me as well. I have a few main ones I want to discuss.Thanos' power. Got wrecked by Thor with Stormbreaker in Infinity War when he HAD all the Infinity Stones and struggled in some other points in the movie, but quite flawlessly beat Thor with Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, Cap and a seemingly advanced Iron Man with nothing but a sword. That sword is more powerful that a 6-stone infinity gauntlet? And don't even try to tell me that in Infinity War Thanos didn't want to kill anyone. Even without killing them, he destroyed some people in the Battle of Wakanda and he was quite willing to kill Iron Man. Not to mention that he clearly tried to stop Thor but couldn't. Thanos had been evidently portrayed to do whatever he needs to do to get his way.Captain America holding Thor's hammer. That's fine. But how can he summon lightning with it? The hammer doesn't summon the lightning unless it's welder needs to be able to do so. Thor is the god of thunder, not him.Iron Man's gauntlet. Thanos had to go to a magical planet to get it specifically made for him, but Stark tech could do it all along? Thanos couldn've easily stolen Stark tech if that was the case and even so, did none of the other planets Thanos conquered have tech comparable to Stark tech? Also, the way Stark so quickly ""pick-pocketed"" (for lack of a better word) Thanos of those stones was super cheesy.Avengers building got bombed BADLY but somehow everyone lived.At this point my head is hurting so I just want to briefly mention the few points of the movie I loved to not seem like a hater. I'm not going in depth because there are an abundance of praises for this movie on the internet. -The last fight scene when everyone came back was beautiful (minus the plot holes) -I actually liked that Cap was worthy to hold the hammer, just not summon lightning -The emotional intensity of Tony getting saved in the beginning (although Captain Marvel's space taxi idea was a bit corny) -Cap passes on his legacy, but I'm devastated that it wasn't Bucky.If you're STILL reading, thanks for hearing me out. At least I still have Star Wars to look forward to. I'm a big Star Wars fan too. For me, Star Wars is not at all ruined by the new trilogy and I liked The Last Jedi. I have high hopes for The Rise of Skywalker and the entire new trilogy would be a success for me if this last episode is done right.And I didn't actually think this movie was a this bad of a star rating, I just want ot balance it out",0
1099,"This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant. If the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever. It is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing. I have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking. Oh and Iron Man dies",0

1108,"This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn.",0

1112,"What have you done? What were you thinking? 21 movies in and this is the best you can come up with? I'm not sure where to start. Have you worked so long on all these films that you got burnt out? Do you hate the Hulk and Thor characters so much that you would do what you did to them? Time travel to fix things is just lazy writing. Plain and simple. Lazy, unimaginative, boring, and it will always fail to make sense. Let's just start at the beginning of the film. It's the best part other than how did Captain Marvel finds Tony but we can let that slide. It really does not matter. Five years later was your first mistake. By doing this you have shown the world is in collapse. People can not move on. Garbage everywhere, everything is in decay. Only Tony Stark has seen to be able to move on and have a child and be happy. Great. This is where it gets bad. You have made Tony Stark completely selfish again. Just like his first film. He never wants to sacrifice anything of his own to make things right. You gave him a daughter and the second you did that, the second you did that, you had to take her away. You had no choice if you wanted to make it a good movie. That is what he was going to have to lose to fix what had been done by Thanos. But you do not even make it an option. He stipulates that they can all go back in time as long as they don't change the last five years! Why?! The whole world is in mourning. The world sucks. How many people killed themselves after the snap? How many people lost everything they own after the snap? How many children lost their parents? How many parents lost their children? But Tony is happy, so, that's all that matters. Horrible. You made me hate Tony Stark. Next point. Why do they need a spaceship to go to Thanos? Thor has Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker can make a bifrost bridge to anywhere! Thor can go anywhere he wants now. Anywhere! No spaceship needed. Thanos? What did you do to the villain you made so great in the previous film. He has five years in retirement and he's ready to die? Let me explain something to you guys. People do not spend their entire lives to achieve something only to want to die five minutes after they achieve it. Thanos. Poor Thanos. What you did. Thanos would never, ever just sat there and let himself be killed. He knew when he did the snap that people would come after him. He would have been ready. He would have never of destroyed the stones. They would be his greatest protection. Now that you killed Thanos and you destroyed the stones, you put yourselves in a box. How can we fix this? I know, time travel. Quantum Realm time travel. Side note, Janet Van Dyne (Mrs Pym) was in the Quantum Realm for 30 years and she aged 30 years. We'll forget about that movie though. Then you guys think we'll go back and get all the stones from earlier movies. Wrong! You don't have to. All you needed to do was go back and get the Tesseract and the time stone. The Tesseract to travel the galaxy. (Which you really don't need because of Stormbreaker but never mind that) and the time stone to fix the time line. The infinity stones are much more powerful than you guys think or realize. Watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy film if you do not know what I mean. You guys made the script so much harder on yourselves than you had to be. Maybe this is what happens when people spend too much time on one type of characters. Did you guys forget who the characters are? Captain America does not look at his own ass and make a comment. He does not care. It is not in his personality at all in any other film. He does not have any vanity. It is one of the reasons that Peggy Carter likes him. Thor. Poor, poor, Thor. Your lazy writing here is unforgivable. The fat Thor was funny for 15 seconds and then it was irritating for the rest of the film. You should have never of done it. Thor should have been traveling the nine realms with stormbreaker, trying to help those realms recover from the snap. That's what Thor would have been doing. Thor would have tried to do something productive. All of Thor's previous movies meant nothing to you. The character meant nothing to you. How Chris Hemsworth played that part without crying in every scene is beyond me. I hope he was devastated to what you did to his character. The Hulk? Do you guys even know who he is? You hid him in the infinity wars, it was okay. I got it. It made it different, but not to bring him back or to bring him in the way you did here, is beyond belief. We needed to see that transformation. We needed to see how Banner and the Hulk became one. Okay, forget that, you did let us see Banner in the Hulk form but we never got to see a smart Hulk get revenge on Thanos. A smart Hulk who knows how to fight because he is now smart because you wrote him that he is now smart. Wasted opportunity. Vision by the way. No resurrection? No mention at all. Really? Hawkeye? There's a guy that enjoyed the last five years. Maybe Tony would like to lose his family and not to want to change the last five years. Another problem. After the new snap, when you brought everyone back. Hawkeye's wife came back with her cell phone? He has her cell phone charged and on the kitchen counter waiting for her to come back? Did the cell phone company's service survive the snap? Are you telling me that Clint kept the same cell phone plan for five years? Think about that for a second. And this not something I realized after the film. I realized it as it a occurred, sitting in my seat in the theater. Bad writing. Romanoff. She never needed to die because you never needed the Soul stone and two things on that: When Captain America returns the the Soul stone, did he see the Red Skull? That would have been interesting. And second when he returns the Soul Stone, Romanoff comes back too! Another thing you guys did not think that through though. Ant-man? I love Paul Rudd, but Ant man was useless. His daughter does not miss her Mom though? I guess she is like Tony and does not want to undo the last five years. No Fury and Captain Marvel reunion scene? Why not? Don't really care that it was not there, but hey I should at least mention it. Back to Captain America. He would never had stayed in the past and married Peggy. He would not have taken her away from the man she winds up marrying and having kids with. He would never had done that in a million years. He would not have abandoned Bucky. Bucky has no family or friends. None. Steve would not have left hm. Steve would not have left all the people that he had met after the snap. Those people still need help. Let me explain your own script to you. When they reverse the snap and everybody reappears after a five year gap. When Peter Parker goes back to school, half his class is gone. They have all aged and graduated. Make sure you have that in the next Spiderman movie. Plus, the people that came back, did they go back to work? The jobs were still there? How about all the houses that have begun to rot? Who repaired them all? What about people who moved and got remarried? Yeah, let's not remove the last five years. Lets just leave it all intact. What should have happened is what happens in Marvel movies. It should have been fun. It should have made sense. Captain Marvel, who is really the only one able to hold any infinity stones,should of, with the help of all the other characters, gone back in time. With the use of the time stone and the tesseract. She shows up when Thor hits Thanos with Stormbreaker at the end of Infinity Wars and she cuts off Thanos's arm before he does the snap or takes the glove from him. Then Thor kills Thanos or lets him live for another day and Captain Marvel uses the Tesseract to open a portal and disappear before anyone even gets to ask her a question. Timeline in tack. Captain Marvel returns the Soul stone to a very unhappy Red Skull who is now trapped on Vormir again and Gamora returns from the Soul stone. Thanos could have been alive and chasing all the other characters. Trying to stop them from undoing everything he had done. Better yet, he should have had an arc and realized that what he had done did not go as planned and in the end he lets them win. Either way the movie should have ended with Tony giving up his daughter, sacrificing his new family to give everyone else their families back. After all is done. Captain America could have just retired and passed the mattel along. Tony would have retired too after seeing how great life is with Pepper and then tried to make his daughter again. All of these endings are better than what you did but they are also not perfect. I just don't have all the time in the world to think up better ways to make other peoples films. What I do have time though, is to go to movies and enjoy them from time to time and for the last 11 years I have enjoyed most Marvel films. Sadly to say but I think I am done with Marvel. I feel as if you guys, the Russo Brothers have killed it all. All the build up, all the time spending with these characters just so you could change them and ruin them the way you did. I feel as if they have died. I know my opinion is just that, my opinion. I feel that this movie is this generations Return of the Jedi. I loved Jedi when it came out. 5 years later, I hated it. End Game will be that movie for these young people. They love it now, but give it a few years and we will see. This I guess is my obituary for the mcu. I felt so empty after seeing this movie. I felt like it was all a waste. I felt like my friends had died or left me and were not coming back. I needed to get this all out of my system and just say good-bye. I apologize for my poor grammar. If I could get the Time Stone, I would use it to go back to school and actually listen to my English teacher. This is all a very sad ending to what could have been a great era of movies.",0
1113,"I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!",0

It felt like I was watching a serial rather than watching a Science fiction movie which supposed to have action in it 95% of movie contained no action at all The climax even wasn't upto the mark When all the superheroes of this movie finally assembled u will be expecting something grand but nothing happens There is no individual action scene of any of the superheroes even the supposedly ""mighty"" captain marvel has hardly for 5 mins featured in this movie The sacrifice of Iron Man was kind off justified and also predictable Nothing about Hulk!!

I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off. If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories. Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance. Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon.",0

1175,"So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad....",0
1176,"I really wanted to tell this. I hate this movie. It's bad in so many points.Let's start from beginning. Actually, movie starts strong. Not as good as better movies but I enjoyed the fact that Thanos destroyed Infinity Stones. He did what he thought was a good thing.Then things started going downhill. 5 year gap and it's shown so badly. 5 years is a long time period. Yet they try to convey that almost nothing has happened. I get that lots of people disappeared and many people couldn't cope with that. But man, the dialogue by characters... It's not a dialogue that people will say after 5 years. They speak as if they were set apart for about 3 weeks. Noone aside of Thor changed really. It looks bad.Then there's all time travel. They make completely incomprehencible mess of time traveling mechanic and have audacity to say that ""Back to the Future is a BS"". Right. A movie that has more time-changing little details than flaws is a BS but a movie with questionable time travel is legit. GREAT.Then there's entire plot and changes in characters. I'm sorry, but the way how Tony asks to only return those who were removed by Thanos is... Well, it not just doesn't make any sense. It's even worse. If this wasn't a writer's fantasy but rough reality, a ton of people would appear just to die in seconds - airplanes that fell because pilots disappeared, That crashed helicopter in the end of Infinity War definitely isn't coming back. And suddenly world got way more population than planet's ecosystem was ready for. Which means, that we are back to overpopulation, but now it's even worse. Thank you, Tony Stark, you made your way of character development from greedy self-centered jerk to an actual hero and ended being greedy self-centered jerk in the end. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you. Needs of the few exceed the needs of the many, true.Also, whole time skip feels as if movie script was re-written several times during movie production.Next is the humor. Oh god, the humor. I mean, I felt literally uncomfortable because of selfie with Hulk joke. And Fortnite joke felt as bad. Thor now is a laughing stock. Scene that should have been endeering and strong when he talks to his mother is ruined by terrible humor. There are only few jokes that work in the movie. Tells a lot considering that in Shazam that has WAY more emphasis on the humor, jokes feel more sincere and actually funny and I actually laughed at them. Here jokes actually ruin pacing and make me feel uncomfortable.Finally, characters - I was surprised how little I cared for most of them. Captain Marvel is the worst - not only Brie Larson doesn't fit the role, her presense in the movie is (rightfully so) reduced to a minimum and she doesn't do anything important.The ONLY character I cared about was Nebula. Thanks to Caren Gillan's great performance and the fact that dumb jokes don't destroy her character, she was the only character I could actually relate to and was interested in her actions.Also scenes where Tony was talking to his father and Steve vs. Hydra were good as well.So where this leaves us? Well - A very sub-par movie that deals significant damage to several Marvel characters and has inconsistant plot with a few bright spots that don't allow me to drop my score to 2 or 1. This movie is awful and I don't recommend it to Marvel fans or to good movie fans. Jokes are awful, story is bad and characters feel worse than they were before.",0
1177,"I can't believe this movie got a so hight raring. Even hours of this trash can't compete with 15 minutes of other masterpieces that sadly no one talks about. The average audience, who wouldn't even distinguish wes Anderson from Tarantino, cares to write unwarranted reviews, and the fact that the most famous platform in the world (and the last word on the success of a movie or not) allows it, in my opinion, It's an affront to the art of cinema.",0
1178,"Corny lines, Story line sluggish and lazy. Talks about causality in time travel, then goes and kills one self from the past. I think this was made to make money and nothing else.",0
1179,"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be.",1
1180,I wish I could say more about this but my title says it all. Nothing wrong with a good mainstream movie but I rather sit on my toilet for three hours than watch this crap.,0

1187,"This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old. The humor was terrible and the story was fragmented. Really don't understand how people are rating this so high. Maybe another movie, Idiocracy, explains it all - people are just satisfied by dumber crap.",0
1188,"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective. This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce. Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.Not me! I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest.",0
1189, Overated!!! ,1
1190,"Everyone is going to hate me for this review. Partial spoiler.This movie was totally predictable, full of flaws with a repeat of if the Infinity War battle , where IMHO they could have just used the same footage.Does Hollywood have no remaining creative ability?2 hours of slow moving, boring video to get to a totally expected ending.While not a total waste of time I am thankful I got a discount and only paid $4.00 for this film.My wife on the other hand fell asleep",0
1191,There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...,0
1192,"Infinity War is so much better. This movie felt so forced, too many eye rolling gags and a confusing plot. The way Thor and Hulk were handled is criminal.",0
1193, Nope....(Spoiler free) ,0
1194,They throw everything and the kitchen sink and it is boring.The story is so convoluted and starts as a Telemundo famiiy drama before becoming a mess of coincidences. The superheroes play a 5-minute tag sequence at one point.Sigh.Thor with an axe!!! Thor playing earth 21st century video games and drinking beer. I have nothing more to say.,0

1198,"The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing.",0

1201, Missing big time on action ,1
1202,"Way too long, drawn out and long winded. Very little action in it. Very little funny humor. Way too much cringe in it. Especially the ""SJW girl power"" scene towards the end. Massive cheese fest at the end. Couldn't wait for it to end while in the cinema. I enjoyed the last film but this was well below average. These 10/10 reviews are just Marvel fanboys I think.",1
1203," Box office hit or not, the viewers experience of a movie is the real measure ",1
1204,"Not a good movie, if your a fan of the comics go see John Wick instead, poorly written cash grab,",0
1205,"As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie. I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable. As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad.",0
1206, Very Disappointed ,0
1207,"Horrible, terrible, stupid. All the bad names you could call a movie should be directed at this one.It's a pathetic excuse of a movie. It was cool having Guardians of the Galaxy in it, but even their humor and coolness was muted quite substantially.Why am I still even writing about this...",0
1208,"Absolutly terrible film. Endgame does not have any of the power, fights, or any part of any Marvel movie. This feels like a horrible one-off DC movie. The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else.",0
1209, Highly Disappointing one of the worst movies of MCU ,0
1210,"A fat overweight Thor throughout the film, a rat walking across by chance a device to bring Ant man back, weak storyline, weak battle, did Dr strange know all along? Was he the real hero? As soon as you got suspense.....safety was round the corner !!!!Just rubbish",0
1211,This movie is better than joker. Hm.. Totally suckss. Couldn't understand a single thing.,0
1212, Too many holes in plot and too much emotional garbage ,0
1213, Seriously ,0
1214,I give this movie 1 because of course lower this rating and should lower and be under infinity war. The end is good but the kill of thanos in the beginning is so bad and get another thanos form another time line i think the main villan is just replace to another and many thing like black widow can't back because it in another time line but we see this green female back?? And when they back in time the director don't give as a master peace if they ask Christopher to help them they film will be like a bomb,0
1215," Not a movie, but an homage. ",0
1216,"They cant kill the main charectors, just learn from got.",0
1217, Waste of time ,0
1218,"Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie. The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me.",0
1219,"Took an age to build up to the final battle where the solution merely involved jumping on Thanos and steeling the stones. You don't need world war 3 first to get to that point.Anyhow, hats off to the filmmakers for making so many people want to watch yet another mediocre story hidden behind shinny cgi.",0
1220,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",0
1221,"The curtain call of the Avengers is entertaining if painfully convoluted and long. Unlike most of its predecessors, ""End Game"" is over done in the same vein as the Star Wars franchise. It's a disappointment compared to most of the prior Marvel films. I own most of those movies on Blue Ray. I will not be purchasing either of the last Avengers films.",0

1227, Illogical movie ,0
1228, Could have been so much better ,0
1229,Hulk & Thor massively underpowered & underused! Such a let down for such a build up over 10 years & to follow on from pretty much perfection with Infinity War to this is just madness.Some great scenes but the movie overall didn't flow well for me.,1
1230, 3000! ,0
1231,"Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?",0
1232,Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!,0
1233, Just too much ,0
1234,"After infinity war which IMO is the best of all the avenger movies, I was really looking forward to the conclusion.Well, what a disappointment. The story made no sense at all. There was no character progression with Thor almost non existence! How can this be with him being the almighty god of thunder commanding the bi-frost in infinity war?!That pace or the movie was slow and boring, the acting lethargic with a real lack of fun.I found myself forwarding large chunks of this movie just to get to something good!The ending was a total shambles and pathetic! Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!The more I think about it the worse it is.Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.Should have left it with infinity war.",0
1235, Colossal waste of time ,0
1236,This film was too long. The dialogues were boring and formalistic Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity. It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.,0
1237, An Honest Review ,1
1238,This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle. If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.,0
1239,"2hours, no joke.. on a story that struggled to be interesting and felt disattached to the universe most of the time. Then the action begins and you're like finally something is happening! But if you're looking for a well orchestrated and good battles versing Thanos' generals like infinity war well there's none of that they all die as soon as they appear basically. Just like the cameos of the avengers who disappeared, almost as pointless but only over shadowed by Captain Marvel and her 2min total feature time.Then there's the plot holes, e.g. Thanos manages to come to future with his ship full of goons..how did he shrink his ship? (Like the GoG ship in which hawkeye had in his hand.. nope they all came inside it). Cap staying in an alternative past so there was 2 Captains in that timeline then and a Mjonir, but some how that Cap is an old man in their timeline.I love marvel and how they planned for this moment all along. Just a shame that it was rushed and crammed with rubbish finaleto it all.",0
1240,"A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow cliché that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration.",0
